"I agree, naturally there are risks involved and it's a policy that may be open to abuse in some circumstances, however that doesn't justify not allowing it, if the same logic were applied to other things it would be openly seen as ridiculous. It needs to have an open debate, and the safeguards need to be discussed and implemented correctly, instead of the state of affairs at the moment, where it's just a null issue.

It's just as ridiculous for people who don't want to die in pain, and without control, to have to fly, ***on their own*** due to the current law, to another country to die there, away from family and friends.  

However there are issues, such as people being pushed towards euthanasia ""services"", especially if it's a privately-run thing. I highly doubt the government would be keen to finance the whole thing, and if it were a privately run operation there would be cost involved for the patient and where there's profit to be made, there is the possibility that greed and abuse of it might follow. So that's a discussion point there.

"Is it maybe a throwback to a simpler time when suicide was considered sinful? If the church law forbade it, surely the law of the land would do too. All death, for whatever reason except when it was Time, was bad and if you caused some of it, you were culpable.

Whatever about that, law seeks to govern property. When someone is charged with murder or manslaughter, isn't it becasue that individual has unlawfully taken the future of the victim, thieved the life and time that 'belonged' to them and their family, that is primarily where their grievance lies. It is easy to see why the law exists to punish those that 'steal' life but suicide and euthanasia are so fundamentally different to murder and manslaughter. 

If I was to be anti-euthanasia-permitting laws, it would have to be for the same reason as I might have to have if I was pro-life in the abortion debate - that all life is so absolutely sacred, that it, in all it's forms must be protected and prolonged for as long as physically possible.

"Two years ago I suffered [central pontine myelinolysis](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000775.htm) as a result of complications from Diabetes Insipidus.

It meant that for about a month, at the age of 26, I was right on the edge of what you could call 'Locked In Syndrome'. I could blink, turn my head a little, move one arm a very small amount, and make a non-specific 'gahhhh' sound. That was it, physically. Mentally, I was totally capable.

The condition is rare, and it's very rare to happen in someone who is otherwise quite healthy. My Consultant was pretty pessimistic that I would make a recovery at all. I truly, honestly believed that for the remainder of my life, I would watch my condition bankrupt my parents as they tried to accommodate a severely disabled son, ruin the life of my then-fiancee, and live in extreme discomfort in a world which I could not interact with at all.

I wanted to die; I don't think it was an overreaction, I don't think, based on the evidence that was in front of me, that it was a spur-of-the-moment decision. I saw twenty or so years of life ahead of me that would have offered me nothing but misery.

This is just a personal view, and it's worth saying that clearly I made a great recovery. But I know that if I was in that position again with a *guarantee* that it was permanent, I would feel the same. It's not enough to simply be alive; quality of life is crucial. Modern medical science can keep people who alive who are incredibly sick, but it cannot cure them. These people should be able to make a decision about their own fates.

Of course, any law that was actually written would need safeguards, but that is true of any law at all. But the cowardice of politicians, to dodge this issue, infuriates me hugely. We have a mismatch between medical science and our laws, and people like Tony Nicklinson and Debbie Purdy call them to our attention. They are mentally capable people who made a reasonable decision that living in this world was too painful for them. As long as we cannot cure these people of their condition, we should be able to relieve them of their pain.","['would', 'people', 'life', 'could', 'make']",2014-03-08 23:15:48,"{'neg': 0.085, 'neu': 0.792, 'pos': 0.123, 'compound': 0.9445}",positive

"* Personal view from perspective of human rights and respect for peoples wishes : yes.

* Personal view from perspective of almost being a doctor, and genuinely admitting I might actually find it hard to go through with it, even if thinking it was the 'right thing' and in the patients wishes.  (It's really crude, but think of that scene in 'The Dark Knight' where nobody wants to actually blow up the other boat, even though they all agree its the 'right' thing to do', given the circumstances)

* Personal view from perspective of legitimate concerns that it will undermine trust in doctors, even if logically it shouldn't.  It will.  There will always be a story that comes out about someone forced into or cajoled, and some evil doctor who went along with it.  Doctors currently rank as one of the most trusted groups of people in the UK, and maintaining that is an important part of being able to do our jobs effectively.

*Conclusion*

"Many forms of euthanasia are already legal in the UK:

Terminally ill patients often turn down life extending treatments because of the impact it would have on the quality of their life (theory being that it is better to live for for 12 months having 6 good months than have evasive treatment and live for 18 months and only have 3 or 4 good months).

Doctors are allowed to administer pain killers which will have the side effect of shortening the patient's life span but making the pain bearable. 

Both of the above examples are forms of voluntary (and in the case of administrating drugs possibly non-voluntary) passive euthanasia.

The act of suicide is in it self an active form of euthanasia and has been decriminalised since 1961.

It is active euthanasia which is illegal in the UK (where actions are taken to actively end life). Although it does happen in the UK often under the guise of passive euthanasia (most famous example being George V who was given a mixture pain killers (morphine and cocaine) to end his suffering)

Personally I do not see any issue with legalising active voluntary euthanasia. Non-voluntary euthanasia should also be legalised under medical review board. Involuntary euthanasia is another matter (the difference between involuntary and non-voluntary euthanasia is that in non-voluntary, consent can not be given, for example the person is in a coma whereas involuntary euthanasia is euthanasia occurring against the will of the patient.). Whether someone acting as power of attorney over a patient  can express their will changing what would be a non-voluntary case in to a voluntary or involuntary case is were the debate should be. If someone with the power of attorney has the ability to over-rule medical opinion in a case it may also be necessary to legalise involuntary euthanasia for use in some extreme cases.","['euthanasia', 'life', 'months', 'case', 'nonvoluntary']",2014-03-08 22:43:01,"{'neg': 0.096, 'neu': 0.812, 'pos': 0.092, 'compound': -0.8462}",negative

"Yes, but it would need to be done gradually. Individuals would need to make the decision themselves before entering the hospital stating they consent to doctors using euthanasia as a last resort, rather than open the floodgates and allow family to decide other than in special circumstances - the Court could play a part in this as they currently do with turning off life support for legally ""brain dead"" patients.

Before entering hospital for any treatment, patients should be given the option to allow it if, heaven forbid, the treatment goes wrong and leaves them physically and/or mentally damaged that any ordinary and comfortable life would not be possible. I haven't been to hospital for ages but presumably consent forms exist, to limit liability and to show you accept any treatment, like with any contract?

I can't see it being possible that the law would change and people who definitely cannot communicate that they want to die being allowed to do so. Expressing consent is important and just because the opinion of family may want it doesn't mean it's right. The Court should probably get involved in this area to play Devil's advocate, along with medical opinion, to determine if someone who cannot communicate their intentions should be allowed to have their suffering come to an end.

It's my belief that less people will be pushed than currently suffer extreme pain. In fact in places that have legalised euthanasia they have no evidence of it happening at all.

So on the balance of 'total harm caused' it should be legalised.

The important point here is to recognise that LCP was for people who were going to die no matter what we as health professionals do, and die very soon. Therefore it provides a care plan for making that person as comfortable as possible.

If a person is acutely ill, not eating or drinking BUT has the potential for recovery then LCP would not have been used and we would do everything in our power to bring them back. 

People who are going to die in a matter of hours can't really be euthanized in any meaningful way. However interventions to save lives can be intrusive and painful -- why put someone through it if you know they won't survive anyway.

Back to this thread, I think there's the perception or assumption, which is correct most of the time, that suicide often isn't *autonomous* act. The person often isn't in their normal state of mind and wouldn't ordinarily have chosen so but is influenced by e.g. depression. If it were a medical intervention we'd they they wouldn't have the capacity to decide so. And often times with the appropriate treatment and support they can often get better and back to their normal state which isn't suicidal. I appreciate this makes assumptions about what is normal and endogenous/exogenous but its the model society mostly uses.

">The divide looks bad now but the reality will be worse when the under 35s get close to retirement

It's actually going to get a lot worse before then. Over the next few decades we're going to have to deal with the rising healthcare cost from supporting the soon to be retired boomer generation. Traditionally, this wouldn't be an issue because the current working population would outnumber the older population, so you wouldn't need a radical change in taxation to cover the increased cost. But under our current taxation / budget policy, we aren't raising enough money to support them because of the disproportionate size of baby boomers in comparison to the current working population.

As a result, the government (likely the Tories) will have to make some 'tough' decisions over the next decade about how they deal with the increased cost associated with an ageing population, and when you consider who their current policies typically favour (e.g. pension triple lock), you can see that the current working population will be the one's who get shafted, Millennials and Gen Z especially.

"I'd just like to play devil's advocate to a couple of your points:

&#x200B;

> Labour has abandoned its left wing grassroots followers.  I also hard disagree with how he's treated Jeremy Corbyn and his supporters .

It kinda has to - appealing to their grass roots didn't get them a majority in parliament in any of the last 4 General Elections. They could either keep doing what they've been doing and continue to not get a majority, or try to change it up. Keir Starmer was chosen as leader to take the party in a different direction to JC, and that means JC and his crew have to be thrown out on their arses. Unfortunately, that's the reality of politics. It also helps to try to draw under the whole antisemitism debacle.

&#x200B;

> Tories are just vile and evil

Statistically, they can't all be evil. Two decent Conservative MPs that come to mind are Ruth Davidson and Rory Stewart (although Ruth Davidson is technically a Scottish Conservative, and Rory Stewart resigned from the Conservative party in 2019 and has since left politics). It's just the worst seem to tend to float to the top, but that's no different than every large political party all over the world.

&#x200B;

>Liberal Democrats cannot be trusted and nobody will vote for them after what Nick Clegg did.  If Clegg broke apart from the Tories when they planned to treble tuition fees, he would have absolutely saved face and would have gained a lot more respect. Heck, he may have actually won a re-election.

I'm going to put my tin foil hat on for a minute: If you were a Conservative in the coalition government and you wanted to destroy the Lib Dems in the next election, which single policy would you pick to sabotage? The Lib Dems basically had this choice: either abandon their tuition policy and work in the coalition government for 4 more years to get their other policies through and loose a bunch of seats at the next election, or break up the coalition government immediately which would've likely have caused a snap election in which they would've lost a bunch of seats anyway. It was a no win situation. 

&#x200B;

> Greens ... oppose nuclear power

Yeah, this is pretty dumb. It's a holdover from when nuclear waste was just dumped into the ocean. The UK stopped doing it in the early '80s and we've made big strides in creating safe disposal methods, but the Greens ignore it because they're still trying to court the ""nuclear = bad"" crew.

Instead it just raises the cost of moving from one place to another since things like estate agent’s fees and stamp duty (in normal times) are tied to the cost of the property. I’d be a lot better off if house prices were a tenth of what they are now. 

I can’t help thinking that this inter generational thing is misdirection. Young people are getting far worse off, yes. But are older people *in general* getting better off? No, I don’t think so.

"I think you benefit by already having the opportunity to own that property, the property you own is almost certainly in positive equity by a large margin and you would have no issue financing a move because you have that equity ready to go when you want to use it. Young people have none of that.

The issue isn't moving it's getting the opportunity to own in the first place, and you being in the position of owning already is the benefit. The young are taking on all of the downsides you mentioned (stamp duty not so much if you're under the threshold for a first-time buyer, admittedly, but so few livable family homes cost under that) plus the added burden of the bar of entry being 10x higher than it was 20 years ago.

I may be way off base, but I earn more than both of my parents combined (just below the 50k upper tax bracket) and the only way I can afford to buy property before I start to wrinkle is to move to Yorkshire, and even then it's a push. (which could get me started on the obvious bias of the market against single people, but I won't go there because I can only stand on so many soapboxes today)

Younger people can’t afford the small semi, which means they’re stuck renting, and paying off someone else’s mortgage. 

I’ve been renting a small flat for almost £850/mo for 12 years.

When you buy a house, eventually the mortgage payments stop and you live rent/mortgage free. When you rent it never ends.

Rent payments tend to be enough to cover the mortgage, maintenance, agency fees and a profit margin, so rent is much more expensive.

* Throw money at autonomous vehicles and other rapid transit solutions in those regional centres. Unified transport policies for Manchester, Leeds, Birmingham etc and fast underground metro systems can add massive amounts of transport capacity in these cities for less than the marginal improvements being made in London.
* Basic income of ~£600/mo. Abolish most benefits (disability benefit remains). Halve the minimum wage. Abolish housing benefit, council tax benefit, jobseekers' allowance etc.  
* Land Value Tax instead of council tax, insurance premium tax, corporation tax, business rates, inheritance tax.

The trouble with this is that it'd lead to people being forced into doing completely unsuitable work. Community work is a punishment option available to the courts and would just be treated like that.

Let's say you've got an industrial electrician on the dole because he's a single parent and can't get the hours to fit. There's no point making him put on an orange vest and pick up dog shit and fag ends when he could be doing something useful for the council with his skills.

I'm not sure I agree with 'up to a limit'.  
[examples] If you had a £300k house and the limit was £250k some would only leave £50k. If you had a £3m house and the limit was £250k some would leave £2.75m. If the rate kicked in past £250k then the person with the £300k house could still pass on £250k whereas the person in the £3m home could also leave a minimum of £250k.

* Unprotect houses to pay for social care. Elderly need to pay their way just like the rest of us, they have earned a ridiculous amount of money by buying houses cheap, it shouldn't be protected because it's a house and not money in the bank. Up the protection limit to £150k.

Some interesting options were presented [here](https://twitter.com/JeremyCliffe/status/879081274970918912) by Jeremy Cliffe - Berlin Bureau Chief at The Economist:

- Abolish the green belt, replacing it hectare-for-heactare with new national parks

- Build 5m houses in 5 years under the mantra: ""private where possible, social where necessary.""

- Immediately guarantee the permanent rights of all EU citizens in Britain

- Commit to staying in the Single market and reforming free movement from within.

- Abolish the immigration cap and introduce ID cards, paving the way for a sensible immigration regime.

- Raise Foreign Office spending to 0.2% of GDP.

- Share Trident (and its costs) with Germany and work with Germany towards multilateral disarmament.

- Abolish VAT.

- Introduce a Land Value tax.

- Create a long-term path to higher inheritance taxes and lower income taxes.

- Combine the DWP with a new consumer rights ministry.

- Expand the Catapult network and allow it to spin out private companies.

- Split England into city states and devolve domestic powers to them.

- Grant Scotland home rule

- Abolish the Lords and replace it with an elected Senate of city states and nations.

- Introduce PR.

- Increase health & social care funding by adopting a Sweden style social insurance model.

- Accelerate construction of HS2.

- Immediately green-light HS3, Crossrail 2 and Crossrail 3.

- Launch planning for HS4, HS5, Crossrail 4 and Crossrail 5.

- [Move Britain's capital from London to Manchester](https://www.economist.com/blogs/bagehot/2017/02/go-north).  *[planning for this should start immediately. -smargh]*

Six others from my own wishlist:

- Resolve city centre air pollution with delivery hubs in the capital & all major cities with last-mile nationalised package delivery company with electric vehicles.

- Commit to spending at least £5bn per year on comprehensive, mostly segregated, cycle network.

- Zero (or almost zero) VAT on fully built bicycles, components and safety gear.

- Consult on banning ""dirty"" residential fuels such as coal & wood burning stoves within five years. Ban outdoor residential burning.

- Diesel vehicles with their CAT removed should be given six months notice, followed by being seized & scrapped without compensation. Any MOT testers proven to pass such vehicles will be subject to a six month driving ban and a 1 year ban on working as a mechanic.

- Immediate ban on 2-stroke motorcyles from city centres to help deal with motorcycle/cycle theft and help with air quality.

Increase minimum wage, decrease working tax credits. All they are is state subsidisation of low wages. 

Legalise Cannabis, use money for NHS and treatment of addiction to more serious drugs. Earmark some money for pay rises and training for nurses and doctors, as EU ones will be leaving. Decriminalise all drugs if the amount discovered is reasonable for personal use.

Stay in Single market, yet leave. I'd rather 100% remain but I believe it's a healthy enough compromise. Either this or hold a referendum on exit deal, if we don't like it we remain. (Although that'd be dependent on a willing EU.)

Increase funding for schools, and also adult education. Make student loan cut off rise with inflation again. 

Remove public sector pay cap. Also remove triple lock. (Keep it at inflation or cost of living, to make it fairer. Re-evaluate later in term just in case.)

Empower Electoral commission more. Breaking electoral rules will come with significantly heavier penalty, including forced By-Election. 

Increase funding for council house building. Try and build more private housing, but prioritise cheaper state housing so people who cannot afford rent or housing get somewhere first. Remove right to buy, or make it a lot harder. Also ensure affordable homes are actually affordable. Building one £100k house and 30 £500k houses is not an affordable development. Also prioritise flats, as they're cheaper than houses.

Increase income tax on higher earners, those over £60k per year. (Scaled increase between that and £500k.) Hopefully this, higher tax income from a higher minimum wage, and the decrease in needed tax credits, will help balance things.

2. Don't leave the EU, it was a non binding referendum, we should capitalise on the result and push for reform of the CAP etc.

4. Set up a nationalised bank where if there was another financial crisis instead of just handing money to banks, the government buys the bad debts on the cheap and uses the tax and NI system to take a nominal sum each month until recouped, this would keep more money in the economy and not penalise people as much.

- Legalise cannabis and decriminalise other recreational drugs.  
- Set up a bottle/can deposit scheme, better enforce littering laws, and put a 5p tax on each packet of cigarettes and chewing gum sold, with the proceeds used to fund street cleaning.  
- Devolve further powers to Holyrood so that only international development, the constitution, security and defence are reserved.

This way the people are still protected, but the state is not exploited.

A focus on self-sufficiency, with an ultimate goal of Britain ending reliance on foreign food imports.

Government aid to those who need it through nationalised services, but also freedom for businesses to expand within the nation providing they do not cause harm to the state and people. Vanguard Britannia recognises the importance of a free market, but also the dangers of unregulated capitalism.

"""Dementia Tax"" to be replaced with ""Dementia Axe"". This 3 foot long piece of hickory, topped with a head of sharpened steel will be personally wielded by Jeremy Hunt to quickly and effectively end the drain on resources caused by the elderly suffering from the debilitating condition. People over the age of 65 who fail the mandatory memory test and are not members of the House of Lords will be swiftly executed. In a Newsnight interview, Mr Hunt described the new policy:


""We've been over the numbers countless times, and we are now agreed that this is the most cost-effective way to end the financial burden of elderly care. Yes, the post-execution clean-up will cost money, but it will also provide jobs across the country.

"> House prices have increased 259 per cent since 1997 compared to a 68 per cent increase in average earnings in the same period, making houses in England and Wales the least affordable they have ever been, the Office for National Statistics said on Friday.

>The average house now costs 7.6 times average annual earnings, compared to 3.6 times earnings in 1997, the ONS said.

>The rise in house prices has helped to reverse a century of rising home ownership and driven an increase in private renting, especially in London where house prices have risen the fastest.

> Figures from the annual housing survey, published earlier this month, found that home ownership in Britain had fallen to the lowest level since 1985 last year — 62.9 per cent of the population owned their own home down from a peak of 71 per cent in 2003.

> While all areas of the UK have become more unaffordable over the past two decades, the gulf between earnings and prices is widest in London and particularly in the borough of Kensington and Chelsea. The most affordable part of the country is Copeland, in Cumbria.

> A resident of Copeland would need to pay 3.6 times average earnings to buy a house, compared to 26.4 times earnings for the wealthy west London borough.

> The recent fall in affordability is mostly driven by London and the south of England. Houses in many parts of the country — including the north east, Wales and Yorkshire and the Humber — were more unaffordable in 2007 before the financial crisis.

>A resident of London would have needed to pay 12.9 times their earnings to buy a house in 2016, up from 6.9 times in 2002.

"The current state of the UK housing market is the result of failed policy going back years. Thatcher's government decided that the free market should build the houses of the nation and destroyed council housing. The blair government saw fit to continue this. The problem is we don't have a free housing market, as NIMBYism, restrictive zoning and development laws, and a cultural distaste for building up or out seriously limits the amount of housing that can be built. That's before talking about the skills shortage facing construction firms.

The result is what we have now, and the solutions are to bring back social housing and/or to address the laws constricting the market. Both are politically improbable so I wouldn't hold out much hope.","['housing', 'market', 'result', 'back', 'government']",2017-03-19 11:41:00,"{'neg': 0.094, 'neu': 0.807, 'pos': 0.1, 'compound': 0.2023}",positive
"It's a myth that houses are expensive because there's not enough land to build on. Between 95-98% of the UK is undeveloped, depending on exaclty how you define ""developed"". 70% of the UK is just monocrop farmland that constitutes 1% of our economy and less than 1% of employment.

We could double our housing capacity and still have 90%+ of the UK undeveloped.

The reason home building has ground to a halt (from 400,000 a year to 100,000, whilst demand grows), is because home owners went from a minority to a majority, and so there became a strong political incentive to cater to home-owners, namely restricting development through Local Planning Authorities and Town and Country Planning Acts, which keeps house prices high.

Factors like cheap credit, land banks, stagnating wages are only exacerbating factors, not the cause. We have a housing shortage because its deliberate policy, because keeping houses scarce keeps them valuable and home owners like to see their homes go up in value and will crucify any government that implements policies that would crash house prices (such as removing all the legal restrictions on building that caused house building)

In an efficient free market, higher price creates higher incentive to supply. Houses being more expensive should mean that its even more profitable to turn a patch of land and a pile of bricks into a domicile. The opposite of that is happening because there is no free market in housing, because it would make housing too cheap and available which people hate once they already have a home.

You can see ""save our greenbelt"" protests all around the country now, even though the government has only slightly encouraged house building, even though all those homeowners complaining live on houses that were once built on a ""greenbelt"".

The NHS only has so many psychiatrists, psychologists and therapists and getting any kind of mental health support is neither easy nor straightforward. 

Please also keep in mind all the creative, community and artistic enterprises that got wiped out during COVID lockdowns. There's a lot of brilliant, creative minds that we're never going to hear from ever again because far too many people have either burned out or are about to burn out just struggling and trying to keep body and soul together. So many people are being forced to give up their passions and creative pursuits, and disciplines, simply because they're struggling for money, desperate to survive, and don't have the money, the resources, the space or the support. 

Think about that, no new music, no new books, no new theatre, no new films, no new culture, no new community initiatives or support, no humanitarian activism, because there's no money, investment or interest in developing such initiatives. Politicians claim to support such stuff, but won't lift a finger to support access to space, investment, funding or money. 

It's all work, work, work, or get a job, get a job, get a job. Please keep in mind that COVID and lockdowns wiped out a lot of the creative and artistic industry. 

It's very clear what's going on here, the Tories are trying to dismantle not just the NHS but the entire welfare state and get rid of all social security and social safety net. As they force people into work they will get rid of benefits, get rid of pensions, get rid of healthcare, and we will all be forced to work and serve to survive, or we will be destitute, homeless and left to die, penniless, destitute, isolated and used up. 

People here need a massive dose of Wake The Fuck Up and Smell The Coffee. Rest assured that once this social safety net goes all you comfortably off professional middle class types will be next.

Quite a lot of people have health conditions that fluctuate. So I have pretty bad post traumatic shit and my sleep quality can massively impact my ability to function safely.

"Sick note crackdown to get more people back into work  
Doctors told to sign fewer patients off under proposals to reinvigorate the economy  
By  
Ben Riley-Smith,  
 POLITICAL EDITOR and   
Nick Gutteridge,  
 POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT  
14 February 2023 • 9:51pm  
Doctors are to be told to sign fewer people off work with sick notes and instead help them to remain in employment under plans being considered for next month’s Budget.  
The Treasury and the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) are examining how to reverse a marked rise in the number of people off work with long-term sickness in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.  
The Telegraph can reveal that one idea under consideration is a new approach to how GPs decide whether people are too sick to work.  
Doctors would be encouraged to focus on recommending ways people with long-term illnesses can continue to work with support rather than using sick notes to authorise them to drop out of the labour market entirely.  
A government source said: “The mental health benefits of work are well established. We want to do all we can to encourage as many people as possible to stay in work with the relevant support in place to help them do so, including signposting them to that support at the earliest possible opportunity.”  
Jeremy Hunt, the Chancellor, will put getting people off out-of-work benefits and into employment at the heart of his Budget on March 15, arguing that it will help to deliver economic growth.  
Downing Street and Treasury officials believe that the number of people out of work but who could be in employment is a major barrier to economic growth. It comes after the International Monetary Fund said that the UK was on course to be the only major economy to shrink this year.  
Some 2.32 million people were signed off with long-term health conditions last summer, according to the Labour Force Survey. That is up from 1.95 million before the pandemic in the summer of 2019.  
During that period, there was a notable rise in people signed off with mental illnesses such as phobias or nervous disorders - up from 257,000 to 313,000.  
Musculoskeletal issues were also cited by sources as a health problem that should not necessarily mean people are permanently out of work.  
Whitehall insiders believe that more could be done by GPs issuing sick notes that help people in such positions to keep working, providing advice on the right structures and support needed.  
More radical potential shake-ups, such as giving government-paid work coaches a more direct role in the sick notes system, are not expected to be adopted.  
Final decisions on the welfare-to-work proposals, which are being drawn up by Mel Stride, the Work and Pensions Secretary, have not yet been reached.  
When he was chancellor, Rishi Sunak pushed the DWP to go further in encouraging people to move off benefits and into work. He tasked Mr Stride with the drive before Christmas.  
Treasury insiders continue to insist that there remains little money to play with for next month’s Budget, despite the sharp fall in energy prices and signs inflation has peaked.  
Calls from a vocal group of Tory backbenchers for tax cuts are being rebutted, with No 10 and No 11 focused instead on halving inflation this year.  
Sick notes, renamed ""fit notes"" by the Government, are official written statements from a registered healthcare professional giving their medical opinion on a person's fitness for work.  
Many of those who are too sick to work in the long term can claim benefits from the Government to support them through financial hardship.  
Work 'good for your health'  
Stephen Evans, chief executive of the Learning and Work Institute, said: “Good quality work can be good for your health and wellbeing, depending on your condition, and being out of work can be harmful to your health.  
“Ensuring health professionals take full account of that in working with people to decide how much they may be able to work makes great sense.   
“Ultimately, most people want to go back to work when they are well enough to do so, and this approach can help make that happen.”  
Mr Stride is exploring other ideas to encourage people back into work - especially for those aged over 50, whose departure from the labour market has been a notable trend since the pandemic.  
One idea being looked at is putting work coaches in GP surgeries, with doctors able to refer older patients who express an interest in getting a job to them for advice.  
Another is to introduce tax breaks for companies that take on responsibility for employee wellbeing by providing physiotherapy and mental health support.  
Mr Stride also wants to reach early retirees with financial advice, with many set to be told that they do not have enough cash to see them through life.  
He is seeking to substantially increase the provision of “mid-life MoTs” and is encouraging pension companies to offer them to all clients who are over 50.

Yes. Our old archaic laws have stupid definitions and yes, it's not called 'rape' by name (this isn't the first archaic law with a dated definition).

But they still get charged with a crime (I can't remember the exact name) and it has **the same punishment and sentencing**

"Hey there!  
My names Sam, I'm in my mid 20's and have had a bit of a rough childhood, I've been suffering with depression for over half my life and have tried too many things to count to try find something that lets me see what other people see in this world.  But, alas, I've not succeeded yet.  
Anyway, I've grown tired, and come to the conclusion that for me, this world just isn't right. Yet, due to the laws surrounding euthanasia I'm unable to do anything good with my demise.  
I'm sure some of you here about the amount of suicides there are by trains, and I fully understand why, there's not an easier alternative, but this comes with a unique downside; you scar the driver and ruin your body. Two things I don't want to do. 
Why? Because I don't want to do more harm than I have too when leaving this world, I'd rather give my organs away, and pass away with those who'm know me knowing I got what I wanted and was happy with that choice. Not that I was forced into flinging myself into a train.
Anyway, that's the rant. I've been looking at alternatives for a while, but for allot of them I don't have the required resources and for euthanasia in Sweden I don't tick all the boxes.  
I'm hoping that It doesn't come to doing something that harms/scars others, but I'm afraid of not being able to find a peaceful way out.

"If other countries in Europe which have legalised euthanasia hadn't made such scary additions to the law since it was first introduced — Belgium in particular now looks truly *dodgy* with its humongous list of people who can be killed by doctors, including children or depressed people (which let's not forget is not a terminal illness, and often recoverable with treatment) — perhaps it would have done a bit better, but the examples are just too worrying. Everyone knows the salami slice tactics of law changes, and the way mission creep begins to make things more permissible which at first would have been beyond the pale and certainly never voted through if they'd been in the Act originally, so if anything this debate came years too late. The PR would have been better a few years ago.

There is a problem in this sub in that everyone has exactly the same view and the few who don't are voted down so are invisible. Remember that this is not a representation of the country, and nor of the country's future (I remember being a left-wing student too, but most people grow out of it, and many here will too) and there's a lot more to arguments than meet the eye at first. The views I see here are so confidently stated but completely simplistic, and not backed-up with proper thinking. Not that mine are any better now I'm older — just now I know that I don't know, whereas before I thought I did. Before anyone says I'd think differently if I saw suffering, my father died over a long period of time with a combination of lung cancer, alcoholism and starvation. My wife had depression for much of her 20s. One of them would have been eligible for euthanasia immediately, and my wife eventually too (no smart-aleck comments about the law not being about depression — *it would* have changed within 15 years, because that's what's happened in other countries too; once you cross the threshold which says that medicine is no longer about keeping people alive, then there is no longer a logical end anyone can agree on). You can't base political policy on anecdotes anyway.

This message is about to go downwards because it doesn't conform to the values of the group, but essentially just remember that because something is popular here it doesn't have much to say about whether it's a widely-held view beyond this sub, nor that this place has any moral high ground that other people don't.

Secondly, that an individual could get pressured into choosing death due to guilt of being a burden on family, or even simply from abusive family members.

There's every chance they might find a cure, or at least a way to make my life more bearable - that, to me, seems worth it.

It would be disastrous to merge social care with health, utterly completely disastrous. The medical model does not complement the social model of care in the manner that would allow this to occur without serious detriment to the provision of social care.

Care homes wouldn't need that amount of money per week, per person if it wasn't for the fact they seek profit, huge profit. That's why hedge fund managers have invested in our care homes. 

The lack of funding is glaringly purposeful. Central government wants to fuck social care so it can gut it and either sell it or add it to the ever growing undercover privatisation of health care. 

Social care is fucked. Hundreds of committed social workers and social care workers try hard to get people the care they need. But their upper managers are far too involved in the politics of local government to remember their social care ethics.

It's not difficult to get into a care home if they are available, it is difficult to get the Care Act right of choice though. Yes you do have to pay if you own over 23k in savings, but that's a fair amount of money tbh.

">The National Health Service (NHS) in England is under unprecedented strain. So it is baffling that more than one in ten of its beds are occupied by patients who do not need them. Some 13,600 inpatients are medically ready to be discharged yet remain in hospital—more than double the number five years ago. This is bad for them, as unnecessary stays tend to weaken patients and increase their susceptibility to infection. It is even worse for the sick people waiting outside in ambulances, queuing in record numbers to get in.

>Discharging a patient requires a dizzying amount of administrative work, with doctors, social workers and managers all having to sign off. Much of this bureaucracy is still done on paper. “It is easier to track a pizza than it is our patients across health and social care,” says John O’Connell, who is leading an NHS pilot scheme to digitise the discharge process. One problem, however, cannot be solved by technology. Increasingly, when patients are ready to leave, there are no carers available to look after them.

>In 2021 the number of workers in adult social care fell by 50,000, the first decline in the decade that there have been records. There are 165,000 vacancies; one in 11 posts is unfilled. As the workforce dwindles, so does the quantity and quality of care on offer. The proportion of older people receiving state-supported long-term care is decreasing, but this does not seem to be because their needs are diminishing. Public satisfaction with social care, always lower than with the NHS, fell from 29% three years ago to a dismal 15% in 2021.

>Frustration stems in part from a complicated system. Long-term social care, consisting of both in-home care and care in nursing and residential homes, is supplied by thousands of mostly private providers. It is difficult to get publicly funded care. In order to qualify, a person must typically be deemed by their local authority to have both high needs and assets of less than £23,250 ($28,100). Separate funding streams hobble efforts to integrate the NHS and the social-care system: money for social care is still primarily funnelled to local authorities through the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, not the Department of Health.

>More fundamentally, in the decade from 2010 the funding of local authorities fell by half in real terms. Some losses were made up by rises in local council tax and by the introduction of a special social-care “precept”, or levy. But in 2020-21 prices, social-care spending still fell from £514 per adult citizen in 2010-11 to £478 per adult citizen ten years later.

>Josh Hawker of AbleCare Homes, which runs six care homes in the south-west, says his firm needs £800-1,000 per week to look after a client. That seems cheap given that it costs the NHS at least £2,500 per week to keep someone in hospital. But Mr Hawker says that Bristol city council pays £771 for each state-funded client, almost irrespective of their needs. The “council just aren’t paying what it costs to look after people”, he says. Self-funders, who make up the remaining third of residents, end up paying more to subsidise others.

>The miserliness exerts downward pressure on wages. At £9.50, the median hourly wage of a care worker is less than that for an easier job stacking shelves at a supermarket. One of Mr Hawker’s employees had been an “excellent” care worker for a decade, he says. But when she quit to start an entry-level job as an administrator in the NHS, she instantly received a pay bump of 30%. When they are unable to find replacements, some providers fill the gaps with exorbitantly priced agency staff. Others make do with a smaller workforce.

>The losers are society’s elderly and most vulnerable. Age UK, a charity, estimates that around 2.6m adults who need some kind of care are not receiving it. In the first three months of 2022, 2.2m hours of home care could not be delivered because of a shortage of staff. Providers such as Right at Home, a home-care franchise, are increasingly focusing on self-funding clients. “It means we can pay our workers more,” says Lucy Campbell, the CEO. Those who cannot afford such services may have to go without, or rely on unpaid carers instead.

>Care homes must contend with soaring energy costs as well as worker shortfalls. That means making tough choices. At best, carpets grow shabbier and walls aren’t repainted. At worst, clients with more complex (ie, costlier) needs are turned away. Profit margins are at their lowest since the Care Quality Commission, a regulator, began monitoring them in 2015. “You’d be mad to open a care home at the moment,” says Mr Hawker.

>The autumn statement on November 17th did bring some relief. Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor of the exchequer, pledged up to £7.5bn of extra money for social care over two years, a chunk of which will come from allowing local authorities to raise council tax.

Sadly, just like brexit, people are blaming the wrong thing. Austerity isn't a choice, it is a fact of life one way or another. You either pay more taxes and are poorer, you borrow more and make your children poorer, or reduce public services and are poorer. I know, I know, there are a lot of economically left wing publications who tell you this isn't true but in my opinion, they're all deluding themselves thinking there is a free magic money tree.

The fact is that western nations have previously enjoyed very high standards of living compared to the developing world and a lot of that was on income borrowed from the future (us in case you missed that point). We are now suffering the consequences of this and it has to play out, there is no other way. I don't want to repeat those same mistakes and kick the can down the road to our children to pay for.

Trust me, I'm as infuriated as you at the situation. But I recognise it differently to you. I recognise that there are a bunch of older people who enjoyed enormous benefits and reaped all the rewards of a period when world growth was very high. But now we, the younger generation have been left holding the debt and must pay for an ageing population.","['pay', 'poorer', 'people', 'isnt', 'fact']",2017-02-21 09:50:04,"{'neg': 0.16, 'neu': 0.705, 'pos': 0.135, 'compound': 0.2998}",positive

I personally find it pretty bonkers that people go to the grave owning so many assets.

For example, my parents finished paying off their property many years ago and have several generous pensions funded - they don't need their state pension.

"What we're seeing here, in my opinion, is the start of the collapse of the 20th century model of society. 

Our system just was not designed to support people living and not working for 30 or 40 years after they retire. To sustain the current model would cost a lot more in tax. That can either come from the well off (political suicide) or the plebs (political suicide) so instead the tories tinker around with sticking plasters like mucking about with council tax. 

Even if we could raise enough tax, automation will deal another savage blow to the system in 20 years or so. 

Time for a full and frank reappraisal of how our society works, and specifically the entitlement to the surplus generated that certain people have a sense of. For example;

Amazon has recently opened shops with no staff. There are plans afoot for drones to be used for delivery. Robots can 'pick' orders all night without collapsing or running to the unions. Driverless technology will soon make bulk deliveries by AI plausible. Tesco et al will doubtless follow suite to stay competitive.

In short, it's not out of the realms of possibility that the world's largest retailers will be able to operate with just a layer of senior management paying themselves ever larger salaries whilst the people who would have worked for them do...... what exactly?

If we're not careful, we'll wind up with an Elysium type scenario; educated people selling value add services to other educated people whilst the rest of the world gets forgotten about. 

No doubt the Elysians will feel that they got there through their own brilliance but of course this is bollocks. The advances which will allow this to happen come from research and development often paid for by publically funded universities, using publically funded infrastructure and people who were educated in the state system. Not to mention the fact that harvesting all of the surplus will deny ordinary people the opportunity to make a living. 

We need to talk seriously about redistribution. The onset of automation and technological could usher us into a paradise where ordinary people are freed from toil and illness and can lead long, fulfilling lives furthering the human race through increased access to education and the time and resources to take advantage of it.

Instead, I fear we're being ushered into an age where an ever smaller group of people will horde an ever greater amount of resources while the rest of us can go fuck ourselves.

Assisted suicide/euthanasia is legal in some countries/states and this hasn't become a significant problem. There have been some cases, but these have been fully punished under the laws and should not be seen as a reason to disregard people the right of self-determination to end their life.

Statistically, that has a very low chance of succeeding and can leave someone very much alive but with chronic health issues like liver damage, so that's not a good alternative.

"One of the main reasons I'm opposed to euthanasia is that the vast majority of people that would be asked to carry out the procedure are currently very uncomfortable with doing this according to polls carried out over the years. 

However there is another option, [CDS](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/8184108.stm), that many doctors prefer and which I myself am far more willing to accept. Basically this practice sedates the patient with drugs so that they are no longer conscious and allows the person to die naturally without the doctor or nurse taking an active role in it. Now there is an example of it being mismanaged in that article so this is why I am still apprehensive about this and would want stricter controls.

With euthanasia the biggest worry for me is that people could have their cases mismanaged and die when, unlike with CDS patients, they could still have several healthy and active weeks/months left.

 I know this sounds a little far fetched but to be honest I'm a little worried about getting to a stage where people can be euthanised for ailments that are not terminal.

"My best friends mother had Motor Neurone disease (Same disease that Stephen Hawkins has).
At the end of her life she only had muscular control of 2 fingers on one hand.

She died in agony and took 3 days to slowly die.

Even the elderly in care homes (as long as they are fully mentally competent, should have the option if they wish.

Imagine you are in your 80s - your family doesn't visit, all your friends are long since dead or in other care homes so you haven't seen them for years, and you're surrounded by people in various states of dementia, every day is endless repetition like groundhog day.

Staff wake you up ridiculously early (since they had to do med rounds before day staff clock in), your day consists of being put in a chair in the day room or lying in your bed if you're bedridden.

The day broken only by mediocre meals prepared with the cheapest ingredients and lukewarm cups of shitty tea (got to keep the profits up and can't serve it hot in case you burn yourself).

That's the reality for a hell of a lot of old people in quite a lot of care homes.  They don't live, they just exist - waiting to die and serving only as a source of income for the care home owners.

Now the above might sound bleak - but it's the sad reality in a lot if not most care homes.

I reckon if they wish to 'go' and can prove mental competence, sign paperwork in presence of a lawyer that confirms their wishes and mental state - then forcing them to continue an existence they hate, is more cruel than letting them die on their own terms.
