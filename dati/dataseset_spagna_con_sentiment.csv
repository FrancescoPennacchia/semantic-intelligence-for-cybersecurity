"I will answer you from my point of view:

Euthanasia is a slippery slope that begins by first allowing people with unbearable terminal illnesses to die and ends with doctors and/or psychologists prescribing death for curable but expensive or simply depressed patients. For the state, once a person stops contributing, he is more profitable dead, so a society where euthanasia is accepted could socially promote an obligation/responsibility to commit suicide upon reaching a certain age. The Futurama suicide capsule could soon go from being a joke to a reality, especially now with the enormous group of people who will reach old age alone once the millennial generation, without children, retires.

As stated below, once we begin to consider that there are lives that are not worth living, we will increase the range of expendable lives, little by little. If we add the Malthusian environmental ideas of the people in power, it is very understandable to be against it.

"From a liberal perspective, the association seems incorrect to me. They are two different things:

Euthenasia: Each individual is the owner of his life and can do with it whatever he wants, including destroying it.

Abortion: The baby is the owner of her life and a third party (the mother, for example) decides to take it away from her, thus violating the principle of individual freedom and respect for private property.

If I'm not mistaken, that is the thesis of liberalism on both issues.

As some point out, this comment smacks more of conservatism. Specifically to the conservation of Christian-Catholic values.

Euthenasia is still a type of suicide, when it is the same person who decides to carry it out, or kill the person, if it is decided by a third party. Both are serious faults (sins) according to Catholic values.

On the other hand, abortion is understood as killing the baby, which is killing, which is again a serious offense (sin) according to Catholic values.

"Just because of a mental disorder, it is more complicated to achieve, although it remains to be seen how it is applied. The problem is that euthanasia will not be given when the doctor certifies that the patient is not in full use of his or her faculties.

This paragraph is also differentiated from the case of mental incapacity, so it could be argued that a person with depression is not in full use of their faculties nor is they completely free in their decisions (a discussion that seems somewhat pointless to me but that carries centuries being discussed in criminal doctrine).

We also have the problem that this is not designed for people with depression. Someone who has only depression does not need help to commit suicide and, therefore, it is understandable that this case has not been considered in the Law (as can be seen from article 8).

They have had them for years and just as there are some who live like zombies, they are functional for what society considers functional but they do not enjoy anything or they cry for anything when no one sees them, until one day they explode, and on the other hand there are the that in one way or another this depression has prevented them from leading a normal life for years, to the extent that they do not do or have done anything with their lives, they do not go out, they even neglect their hygiene or basic needs, it is in those cases that I wonder if It would be considered a disease that causes so much pain that it prevents people from living a normal life, because of course these people are in constant emotional pain that they have no way to heal, you know?

"You ask some things that surely not even the lower courts can answer.

In Belgium there was a case like this in which a girl with depression asked for euthanasia, it was granted and in the end she backed out, so that time bomb was disarmed.

The Law can be interpreted to grant euthanasia to these people, but there are reasons not to grant it. I defend the right to euthanasia, and I do not make decisions, but if I did (doctor/judge), I would reject this type of aspiration, especially in bleeding cases. More than anything to protect the very right to euthanasia. You have to be very strict with the granting of euthanasia so that your detractors cannot find loopholes through which to attack you.

Specifically, euthanasia must be reserved for those diseases that are terminal (without a cure) and that cause an excessive death. Now the question is whether depression meets those requirements. Depression can be treated. Are there people whose treatment does not work? Yes. But there are also new treatments and we must analyze whether the health of the specific person with depression is getting worse and worse, without hope that a (new) treatment will change anything. The situation would have to be causing more and more suffering and although this specific case seems unlikely, I do not think it is impossible.

The LibertadDigital article and practically any ultraconservative argument you see against the law, starts from this premise, I quote from the opinion article:

>The reality is that, in most cases, the right to euthanasia consists of the right of others to decide about the death of a person.

Well, I don't know how to describe it, I think lying or fake news falls short. But well, as you can see in the official document, go to page 5, Article 5. The requirements come:

>c) Have made two requests voluntarily and in writing, or by other means that
allows us to leave a record, and that it is not the result of any external pressure, leaving a
separation of at least fifteen calendar days between the two.
If the responsible doctor considers that the loss of the applicant's capacity to
granting informed consent is imminent, he may accept any shorter period that he considers
appropriate depending on the concurrent clinical circumstances, which he must record in
the clinical history.

On page 4, Article 3 shows us some definitions, including *Informed Consent*:

>«Informed consent»: the free, voluntary and conscious consent of the patient,
manifested in full use of his powers after receiving adequate information, so that,
at your request, one of the actions described in letter g) takes place

The letter G is the definition of aid-in-dying provision.

In short, to be killed you must have formally requested it in full mental capacity. And doctors may be conscientious objectors and refuse to do it to you.

Responding to his request made me feel that I could help someone free them from their suffering.

We applied it to him, first a relaxant, then an anesthetic so that it wouldn't hurt. the entry into his arm of the medication that finally paralyzes him. Everyone stops in less than 15 minutes. We left them alone. We were very sad, but it was an expected and desired death. Everyone in the family was very prepared (...) I keep him in mind quite a bit, but I feel satisfied that it turned out well, that he did not suffer more than he had already suffered.

But the concept is one thing and doing it is another thing. You give the injection and close your eyes. It stuck with me.

“The process takes time. The first thing is to make sure of his ability to decide, that he is not clouded. And deliberate with him. Technically it is not very different than when you propose treatments or alternatives, but emotionally it is much more complicated. It is an irreversible decision. It made me stop that deliberation several times and leave it for another day. It was sad and emotional,"" says another health worker.
""It's not that I wanted to die,"" he continues, ""it's that I didn't want to live in those circumstances without solutions. I didn't want to leave my loved ones. It's not easy to say goodbye. Luckily, everyone I loved agreed. It was a very nice situation."" We had to delay euthanasia to find a day and time for everyone (...) It is difficult to escape.

He communicated thanks to the tablet and he couldn't ask him not to use it to relax his arm. I tried every way, I even asked for help from the home hospitalization team, but we couldn't do it. He had been suffering so much for so long that he couldn't add more to it by delaying the moment. I took a valium and told him that we would get it that day,"" recalls a nurse.
""I gave him a subcutaneous relaxant,"" she continues, ""we washed and dressed him and, with his body more relaxed, I was able to put in place the line that would allow him to die and rest once and for all, as he had wanted for so long. As a Primary Nurse I was very involved. I knew I had to do it. I'm lucky because he let me do it. I take great care and pamper my patients. I miss him a lot, but allowing him to rest in peace surpasses any other emotion. I did what I had to, I'm proud. Although in the protocols they have forgotten about the nurses.”

"It is undeniable that we are heading towards an increasingly egalitarian society. Technological, philosophical and political advances lead us to an ever-greater understanding of our environment. There are two types of people, politically speaking: those who are aware that we are approaching a better society and those who are not.

And within these 2 visions we could catalog many other subdivisions, but I would like to focus on these 2 basic ones.

Politicians who are conscious tend to have ideas with a higher ethical bar. It doesn't matter where they are on the political spectrum. The fact that they know that change is going to occur makes them aware of the role they play in society.

Somehow, those aware of change know that their decisions play an important role in the lives of their neighbors. Debates begin on changes in the means of electrical production, universal basic income, elimination of combustion engines, etc. They begin debates with proposals that could modify the behavior of society and lead us to a better world. Among these, the most adventurous, focus their efforts on making the evolution of society happen as quickly as possible, in any way.

On the other hand, those who are not aware that we are approaching a more egalitarian society are the politicians who put obstacles in the way of everything. For them, any change is a mistake that would lead to a huge gap in the public coffers and nothing is possible. Their position is to delay the current status quo and sometimes, the most clueless, even decide to go back a few steps.

It is easy to recognize and classify certain parties and politicians in the world into these 2 categories, if we look at countries with higher democratic standards.

In the case of Spain, I think it is clear that the right would be part of the unaware. The effort they make to delay the advancement of society is much greater than their effort to advance. The PP is strongly represented here. They move heaven and earth to eliminate advances like the recent [recent appeal against the euthanasia law.](https://www.ondacero.es/noticias/espana/motivos-pp-vox-contra-ley-eutanasia_202012175fdc4644904ac70001718953.html) They remain fully portrayed, as has happened on other occasions.

In the case of the clueless, obviously we have VOX. They want to go back to the golden years where there was only education for their children, so they can continue oppressing the poor for a few more generations. For this very reason [VOX is pleased with the measures recently taken in Hungary, ](https://mobile.twitter.com/vox_es/status/1407992542407299075) in addition to having such a controversial fascist reputation.

Ciudadanos seemed like a party aware of the change. For many it was precisely the option of the conscious on the right. But in Spain there is a serious problem with the unconscious, which they did not see coming.

The inheritance of the right is its main problem. Other rights in the world had to fight against fascism. Those rights were established with strong ideals. The right in Spain did not have this experience. It could have been that way, but a coup d'état with a dictatorship included ended the progress of Spain and the right that it could have been.

The coup d'état of those who are not aware of the change causes a stagnation in the growth of ideas. Corruption among those close to the regime, who distribute what they loot to the oppressed, is the normal way of life and these practices continue to be fashionable, even today.

Those who are not conscious make decisions that affect their immediate life. They are not able to see society as an evolving entity. Any change is complicated or downright wrong.

Countries with parties in government that are aware of change are among the most cited examples as best models of democracy under a capitalist system. These countries with liberal governments are capable of deciding more or less correctly on proposals that affect society or at least starting debates that lead to this. Some of these countries even include environmental or social issues in their school curricula that could be controversial in Spain.

The way I see this, it is as if the rights of other countries, being aware of their expiration date, wanted to exercise and guarantee their power on the path towards that more egalitarian society. They educate the new generations by further raising the ethical level of their citizens, but not too quickly, lest some unconscious people reveal themselves and start a revolution that ends in a coup d'état.

"You start from a somewhat simplistic premise, that change can only come from the political class. From that premise, what you say does make sense because those political sensibilities closest to liberalism expect that the changes come organically, from the bottom up. If you omit that, it is normal for you to see those who tend to reject too much state interventionism as retrograde people. Political leaders are influential but they are nothing more than another piece in the social fabric. Also influential are artists, journalists, intellectuals, social networks,... all of these can be influential without the need to be linked to a centralizing political party.

And yes, the Spanish right is less progressive than the left, but the problem is that progressivism takes root in prosperous societies and extremism in impoverished societies. Being progressive is extremely easy, it is just a matter of will, of signing laws, but that has to be accompanied by realistic (and unpopular in the short term) measures that generate wealth so that citizens do not have needs and are sufficiently relieved to be open to progress. Economic prosperity is a prior step and if you blame the Spanish right for not being progressive you should also look at the Spanish left and its contempt for the problem of unemployment, its contempt for the risk of reaching critical economic situations if the country does not grow quickly enough, his idea that wealth is something already given and that you simply have to milk the cow and sign progressive laws. You mention the right of other countries, I imagine European, that do do it well, well look at the other side of the coin, compare the Spanish left with other European left that worry that the welfare state is supported by a reality solid and realistic economy based on economic freedom, not wishful thinking and short-termism.

Should intellectual honesty be included as a necessary condition to aspire to that ethical bar?

And the way politics works, at least until today, the politicians who go far have all done so by largely renouncing their principles, they have had to adapt to what sells the most within their party and the discourse that the more votes it generates.

"Absolutely no one on the left defends or has ever defended ""equality of results"", it is an unoriginal strawman. By ""equality"", in simple terms, the left means:

1. The nonexistence of social, economic or political classes. The end of privileges because there is no one in one family or another.

2. The effective equality of fundamental rights, within certain rational limits imposed by the law written by the people for the people.

3. Equality in effective access to the material resources that each individual needs not only to cover their basic needs, but also to pursue their happiness, develop freely as a person and be able to freely choose their social roles, within material and technological limits. of their society.

Is such a society absolutely good? No, there are always limits, but it is the best we can aspire to.

Is it a desirable society? Yes, because when people have the freedom to develop themselves as they wish, to walk their own path, society as a whole functions better. Added to democratic control of the means of production, this leads to people being more comfortable in their work and reduces their anxiety and depression, increasing their productivity and reducing crime and other antisocial behavior. Because when people have their material needs covered, much of their suffering is avoided and crime is reduced again. Because the less important the social or economic status is, the greater the fraternity between people, reducing conflicts, making it easier to reach agreements and consensus. Because when social, economic or political privileges cannot be inherited, it is more likely that the people chosen to hold some power are based on merit and ability, which also answers the question about excellence.

Since everyone would have access to the resources they need to achieve excellence in whatever they decide, no one would feel excluded from this system, except those whose ambition is to hoard wealth to hold power over other people.

How would it be implemented? Well, everyone has their answers. But it doesn't matter, just because something is difficult to do doesn't mean it shouldn't be done.

What does it mean to disagree with a system like this? Disagreement is perfectly acceptable, wanting to reimpose heritable inequality or prevent people from accessing the resources they need is not, obviously.

He has lied in his resume sent to Congress - where he said he had left the office in 2017, but then acted as coordinator for a contract with the Las Rozas city council in 2019. He also broke the law by having simultaneously been a professor at a public university (Rey Juan Carlos in Madrid) and at a private center (Cardenal Cisneros). He appears in the summary of the Lezo case in conversations with the former president of Madrid Ignacio González, in which he says that he is moving to find the “good” prosecutor. Another scandal that has broken out is that he had business [with the confessed front man of Eduard Zaplana.] (https://cadenaser.com/ser/2021/11/01/tribunales/1635760629_250219.html)

He is clearly against the law on abortion and euthanasia (two issues that the Constitutional Court on which he will sit will have to decide)","['PSOE', 'swallow', 'Arnaldos', 'toad']",2021-11-12 07:35:32,"{'neg': 0.074, 'neu': 0.893, 'pos': 0.033, 'compound': -0.8462}",negative

"There are two options.

\-It is swallowed with the toad and there is renewal of institutions.

">They have chosen the lesser evil.

It should be noted that at this point in the film I fully admit the story that ""in politics, the excellent is the enemy of the good"", and that ""the turbopatriarchy does not let us do anything we would like to do.""

But there are lesser evils that are too great to be minor. I don't want to imagine what this man is capable of when he is put in charge of the presentations that must reject the request for unconstitutionality for abortion or dignified death. And if my calculations are correct, given the partial renovations every 3 years, it lasts almost a decade. Agüita.

I would have left the judicial power without renewing it, and let Europe and the polls decide. But for that you have to have a healthy attachment to the easy chair, something that does not happen in any parliamentary group.","['lesser', 'let', 'would', 'chosen', 'evil']",2021-11-12 09:11:28,"{'neg': 0.113, 'neu': 0.725, 'pos': 0.163, 'compound': 0.8387}",positive

"It is not an excuse. It is a reason as big as a mountain. The other options are worse.

If the judges choose them, they become a caste that does not have to answer to anyone, independent of society and controlled by the State. And formed only with Arnaldos appointed by judges related to the PP.

If the parties elect them, at least they represent society. Although there is some Arnaldo.
