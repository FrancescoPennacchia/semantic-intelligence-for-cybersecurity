There are a group of volunteer physicians working for DWD who tweak the medication regimen based off results. The patient has to be able to drink the liquid themselves even if it’s through a straw. If you can’t drink it on your own, you can’t use it. So people with progressive diseases like ALS have a tiny frame of time to work with as they eventually lose ability to swallow. Some people don’t die right away (but they generally don’t wake back up) if they have a generally strong heart/lungs, so it’s typical for the physician or a hospice nurse to be at bedside to continue helping with symptom management. It’s a super interesting process giving deathly ill people the option of when they want to die. I had a patient who planned their death at 5 pm on a Friday so their children didn’t have to skip work.",

Barbiturates were classic anesthetics for many years. \n\nIn anestheisa we give drugs like those (barbiturates are no longer used much) to put people to sleep and patients will usually stop breathing. In anestheisa it isn’t a big deal because we breathe for them by various means. \n\nBut if you take a large dose of anestheisa and nobody steps in to breathe for you, you’re just under anestheisa and not breathing and that, of course, results in a very peaceful death. \n\nI hope for something like this if it becomes appropriate for me and my loved ones one day.",

In therapeutic doses, it will protect patients from seizing and keep them in a non agitated, non delirious state, while the brain restored its homeostasis.\n\nIn mega doses like in MAiD, it causes total anesthesia first (artificial coma), and then respiratory arrest, by inhibiting autonomous  respiratory drive (patients stop breathing). This in turn causes cardiac arrest and subsequent death. Patient is in a coma and don’t feel a thing. Last thing he will remember is being surrounded by loved ones and drinking from a glass.",

I watched and thought exactly that: this isn’t oddly terrifying it’s beautiful, and it’s normal, and it’s something we should all have a right to. What’s terrifying is that most of us won’t get this: we’ll get a slow decay, our loved ones will watch us rot and break down, it will hurt worse every day, our minds will stop working and drive us mad. Medical staff will help us with the pain to a certain extent, but they won’t help us make the whole ordeal shorter. In fact, if we get unlucky and fall on an especially cunty doctor, we could end up with a feeding tube stuck through our nose into our stomach, making the whole ordeal last even fucking longer. We should all have a right to choose a better way to go, but currently very few people do. Anyway I was ruminating on all this and then “holy shit is that terry motherfucking pratchett?”. Millenium hand and shrimp. I had no idea he was into this cause, what a legend. So then I went down a little rabbit hole of research and in case you’re wondering, no: his battle with the horrors of Alzheimer’s apparently didn’t end with him being able to choose his own death. He died naturally. What a nice word for a potentially horrible and unfair thing. I hope that was his decision, and not something that happened because our society sucks at death.",

Several years ago someone I knew who was terminal (and also happened to be British) reached out to me for help with the logistics of getting this set up. She had lung cancer with brain metastasis and the tumors were pressing down in a way that rendered her partially blind & unable to drive anymore. I drove her to her various appointments— to the doctors, the psychiatrist (part of the requirement to be granted assisted suicide), and the pharmacy to pick up the sleeping pills prescription that would be the lethal dose taken all at once. \n\nWhen the time came, I had the honor of being included in the small group of close friends and family to be present for her passing. It took place in a teepee on a pasture. There was a rug and a futon and paper bags of fresh lavender set up inside. Two hospice nurses were present to ensure there weren't any medical complications and to pronounce her. They opened up the capsules into a little cup of juice just like in this video, asked the exact same questions to ensure this was completely of her own free will, and as per law, she had to be the one to take the cup & ingest its contents. The entire thing took probably 10 minutes from last words to death. It was incredibly graceful and peaceful. Afterwards, everyone sat on the rug in kind of a circle with her body on the futon still at the head of the circle, and shared chocolate and wine while we told stories about how we knew her & shared memories of her. \n\nIt was an honor and a privilege to be entrusted to help her, and even moreso to be entrusted to be present for this deeply personal and most vulnerable final moment of her life. And I would go so far as to say that in the days leading up to it, I had some anxiety, when the day and time actually came, it was oddly UN-terrifying. Everyone should be so lucky as to go out with this kind of dignity.",

I can’t imagine how beautiful it must be to know you can die quickly and peacefully being held by a loved one instead of suffering in torment and agony..     \n Death and life coexist in this world, you cannot have one without the other. Death is natural. And I believe it’s a human right. \n\nI wonder why anyone would willing deny this to someone, if they are clearly suffering and have a terrifying death ahead of them. \n\nTo those of you who think this is unnatural.. \n“Playing god” or whatever you see it as, I’d like to ask why this is considered “playing god” and forcibly extending someone’s life through treatment isn’t. \n\n\nOur medicine crossed the line of “natural” years ago. We now live long enough that it’s common to face serious, terrible diseases and states of suffering in elderly years.        We were never meant to live this long. I don’t understand how you could look upon someone who’s in terror and pain and suffering and deny them release.\nDeath is only natural. But our medicine has become too much about extending life, and not enough considering the quality of life. Maybe extending life isn’t always right. Maybe we should look at medicine through the lense if easing the suffering.",

                "Testo del commento": "Comment from a previous thread on how Rabies feels. Not mine. It’s TERRIFYING. \n\nRabies.  It's exceptionally common, but people just don't run into the animals that carry it often.  Skunks especially, and bats.\n\nLet me paint you a picture.\n\nYou go camping, and at midday you decide to take a nap in a nice little hammock.  While sleeping, a tiny brown bat, in the \"rage\" stages of infection is fidgeting in broad daylight, uncomfortable, and thirsty (due to the hydrophobia) and you snort, startling him.  He goes into attack mode.\n\nExcept you're asleep, and he's a little brown bat, so weighs around 6 grams.  You don't even feel him land on your bare knee, and he starts to bite.  His teeth are tiny.  Hardly enough to even break the skin, but he does manage to give you the equivalent of a tiny scrape that goes completely unnoticed.\n\nRabies does not travel in your blood. In fact, a blood test won't even tell you if you've got it.  (Antibody tests may be done, but are useless if you've ever been vaccinated.)\n\nYou wake up, none the wiser.  If you notice anything at the bite site at all, you assume you just lightly scraped it on something.\n\nThe bomb has been lit, and your nervous system is the wick.  The rabies will multiply along your nervous system, doing virtually no damage, and completely undetectable.  You literally have NO symptoms.\n\nIt may be four days, it may be a year, but the camping trip is most likely long forgotten.  Then one day your back starts to ache... Or maybe you get a slight headache?\n\nAt this point, you're already dead.  There is no cure.\n\n(The sole caveat to this is the Milwaukee Protocol, which leaves most patients dead anyway, and the survivors mentally disabled, and is seldom done - see below).\n\nThere's no treatment.  It has a 100% kill rate.\n\nAbsorb that.  Not a single other virus on the planet has a 100% kill rate.  Only rabies.  And once you're symptomatic, it's over.  You're dead.\n\nSo what does that look like?\n\nYour headache turns into a fever, and a general feeling of being unwell.  You're fidgety.  Uncomfortable.  And scared.  As the virus that has taken its time getting into your brain finds a vast network of nerve endings, it begins to rapidly reproduce, starting at the base of your brain... Where your \"pons\" is located.  This is the part of the brain that controls communication between the rest of the brain and body, as well as sleep cycles.\n\nNext you become anxious.  You still think you have only a mild fever, but suddenly you find yourself becoming scared, even horrified, and it doesn't occur to you that you don't know why.  This is because the rabies is chewing up your amygdala.\n\nAs your cerebellum becomes hot with the virus, you begin to lose muscle coordination, and balance.  You think maybe it's a good idea to go to the doctor now, but assuming a doctor is smart enough to even run the tests necessary in the few days you have left on the planet, odds are they'll only be able to tell your loved ones what you died of later.\n\nYou're twitchy, shaking, and scared.  You have the normal fear of not knowing what's going on, but with the virus really fucking the amygdala this is amplified a hundred fold.  It's around this time the hydrophobia starts.\n\nYou're horribly thirsty, you just want water.  But you can't drink.  Every time you do, your throat clamps shut and you vomit.  This has become a legitimate, active fear of water.  You're thirsty, but looking at a glass of water begins to make you gag, and shy back in fear.  The contradiction is hard for your hot brain to see at this point.  By now, the doctors will have to put you on IVs to keep you hydrated, but even that's futile.  You were dead the second you had a headache.\n\nYou begin hearing things, or not hearing at all as your thalamus goes.  You taste sounds, you see smells, everything starts feeling like the most horrifying acid trip anyone has ever been on.  With your hippocampus long under attack, you're having trouble remembering things, especially family.\n\nYou're alone, hallucinating, thirsty, confused, and absolutely, undeniably terrified.  Everything scares the literal shit out of you at this point.  These strange people in lab coats.  These strange people standing around your bed crying, who keep trying to get you \"drink something\" and crying.  And it's only been about a week since that little headache that you've completely forgotten.  Time means nothing to you anymore.  Funny enough, you now know how the bat felt when he bit you.\n\nEventually, you slip into the \"dumb rabies\" phase.  Your brain has started the process of shutting down.  Too much of it has been turned to liquid virus.  Your face droops.  You drool.  You're all but unaware of what's around you.  A sudden noise or light might startle you, but for the most part, it's all you can do to just stare at the ground.  You haven't really slept for about 72 hours.\n\nThen you die.  Always, you die.\n\nAnd there's not one... fucking... thing... anyone can do for you.\n\nThen",

Skunks especially, and bats.\n\nLet me paint you a picture.\n\nYou go camping, and at midday you decide to take a nap in a nice little hammock.  While sleeping, a tiny brown bat, in the \"rage\" stages of infection is fidgeting in broad daylight, uncomfortable, and thirsty (due to the hydrophobia) and you snort, startling him.  He goes into attack mode.\n\nExcept you're asleep, and he's a little brown bat, so weighs around 6 grams.  You don't even feel him land on your bare knee, and he starts to bite.  His teeth are tiny.  Hardly enough to even break the skin, but he does manage to give you the equivalent of a tiny scrape that goes completely unnoticed.\n\nRabies does not travel in your blood. In fact, a blood test won't even tell you if you've got it.  (Antibody tests may be done, but are useless if you've ever been vaccinated.)\n\nYou wake up, none the wiser.  If you notice anything at the bite site at all, you assume you just lightly scraped it on something.\n\nThe bomb has been lit, and your nervous system is the wick.  The rabies will multiply along your nervous system, doing virtually no damage, and completely undetectable.  You literally have NO symptoms.\n\nIt may be four days, it may be a year, but the camping trip is most likely long forgotten.  Then one day your back starts to ache... Or maybe you get a slight headache?\n\nAt this point, you're already dead.  There is no cure.\n\n(The sole caveat to this is the Milwaukee Protocol, which leaves most patients dead anyway, and the survivors mentally disabled, and is seldom done - see below).\n\nThere's no treatment.  It has a 100% kill rate.\n\nAbsorb that.  Not a single other virus on the planet has a 100% kill rate.  Only rabies.  And once you're symptomatic, it's over.  You're dead.\n\nSo what does that look like?\n\nYour headache turns into a fever, and a general feeling of being unwell.  You're fidgety.  Uncomfortable.  And scared.  As the virus that has taken its time getting into your brain finds a vast network of nerve endings, it begins to rapidly reproduce, starting at the base of your brain... Where your \"pons\" is located.  This is the part of the brain that controls communication between the rest of the brain and body, as well as sleep cycles.\n\nNext you become anxious.  You still think you have only a mild fever, but suddenly you find yourself becoming scared, even horrified, and it doesn't occur to you that you don't know why.  This is because the rabies is chewing up your amygdala.\n\nAs your cerebellum becomes hot with the virus, you begin to lose muscle coordination, and balance.  You think maybe it's a good idea to go to the doctor now, but assuming a doctor is smart enough to even run the tests necessary in the few days you have left on the planet, odds are they'll only be able to tell your loved ones what you died of later.\n\nYou're twitchy, shaking, and scared.  You have the normal fear of not knowing what's going on, but with the virus really fucking the amygdala this is amplified a hundred fold.  It's around this time the hydrophobia starts.\n\nYou're horribly thirsty, you just want water.  But you can't drink.  Every time you do, your throat clamps shut and you vomit.  This has become a legitimate, active fear of water.  You're thirsty, but looking at a glass of water begins to make you gag, and shy back in fear.  The contradiction is hard for your hot brain to see at this point.  By now, the doctors will have to put you on IVs to keep you hydrated, but even that's futile.  You were dead the second you had a headache.\n\nYou begin hearing things, or not hearing at all as your thalamus goes.  You taste sounds, you see smells, everything starts feeling like the most horrifying acid trip anyone has ever been on.  With your hippocampus long under attack, you're having trouble remembering things, especially family.\n\nYou're alone, hallucinating, thirsty, confused, and absolutely, undeniably terrified.  Everything scares the literal shit out of you at this point.  These strange people in lab coats.  These strange people standing around your bed crying, who keep trying to get you \"drink something\" and crying.  And it's only been about a week since that little headache that you've completely forgotten.  Time means nothing to you anymore.  Funny enough, you now know how the bat felt when he bit you.\n\nEventually, you slip into the \"dumb rabies\" phase.  Your brain has started the process of shutting down.  Too much of it has been turned to liquid virus.  Your face droops.  You drool.  You're all but unaware of what's around you.  A sudden noise or light might startle you, but for the most part, it's all you can do to just stare at the ground.  You haven't really slept for about 72 hours.\n\nThen you die.  Always, you die.\n\nAnd there's not one... fucking... thing... anyone can do for you.\n\nThen there's the question of what to do",

If you didn't know, rabies essentially liquefies your brain while you're still living. It starts with removing your ability to swallow, then it attacks your nervous system while simultaneously putting you into a confused, dilapidated state (due to your brain slowly turning to liquid inside of your head).\n\nPeople say that it causes you to fear water, but I don't think that's entirely accurate. The disease makes it impossible for you to swallow water, makes you violently shake, puts you into a flop sweat and causes intense confusion. All of these symptoms combined create what we know as \"fear\". The illness doesn't really make you fear water, but the sum of the symptoms coincidentally makes your reaction to water that of fear.",

                "Testo del commento": "I saved this because it horrified me;\n\nThe original author appears to be /u/HotDogen who wrote this over [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/48ujhq/whats_the_scariest_real_thing_on_our_earth/d0mz5uq/).\n\nThey also add the following:\n\n&gt; Each time this gets reposted, there is a TON of misinformation that follows by people who simply don't know, or have heard \"information\" from others who were ill informed:\n\n&gt; Only *x* number of people have died in the U.S. in the past *x* years.  Rabies is really rare.  \n\n&gt; Yes, *deaths* from rabies are rare in the United States, in the neighborhood of 2-3 per year.  ***This does not mean rabies is rare.***  The reason that mortality is so rare in the U.S. is due to a very aggressive treatment protocol of all bite cases in the United States:  If you are bitten, and you cannot identify the animal that bit you, or the animal were to die shortly after biting you, *you will get post exposure treatment*.  That is the protocol. \n\n&gt; Post exposure is very effective (almost 100%) if done before you become symptomatic.  It involves a series of immunoglobulin shots - many of which are at the site of the bite - as well as the vaccine given over the span of a month.  (Fun fact - if you're vaccinated for rabies, you may be able to be an immunoglobulin donor!)  \n\n&gt; It's not nearly as bad as was rumored when I was a kid.  Something about getting shots in the stomach.  Nothing like that.  \n\n&gt; In countries without good treatment protocols rabies is rampant.  India alone sees 20,000 deaths from rabies PER YEAR.  \n\n&gt; &gt; The \"why did nobody die of rabies in the past if it's so dangerous?\" argument.  \n\n&gt; There were entire epidemics of rabies in the past, so much so that suicide or murder of those *suspected* to have rabies were common.  \n\n&gt; In North America, the first case of human death by rabies wasn't reported until 1768.  This is because Rabies does not appear to be native to North America, and it spread very slowly.  So slowly, in fact, that until the mid 1990's, it was assumed that Canada and Northern New York didn't have rabies at all.  This changed when I was personally one of the first to send in a positive rabies specimen - a raccoon - which helped spawn a cooperative U.S. / Canada rabies bait drop some time between 1995 and 1997 (my memory's shot).  \n\n&gt; Unfortunately, it was too late.  Rabies had already crossed into Canada.  \n\n&gt; There are still however some countries (notably, Australia, where everything ELSE is trying to kill you) that still does not have Rabies.\n\n&gt; &gt; Lots of people have survived rabies using the Milwaukee Protocol.  \n\n&gt; False.  ONE woman did, and she is still recovering to this day (some 16+ years later).  There's also the possibility that she only survived due to either a genetic immunity, or possibly even was inadvertently \"vaccinated\" some other way.  [All other treatments ultimately failed, even the others that were reported as successes eventually succumbed to the virus.](https://pandorareport.org/2014/05/01/no-rabies-treatment-after-all-failure-of-the-milwaukee-protocol/)  Almost all of the attributed \"survivors\" actually received post-exposure treatment ***before becoming symptomatic*** and many of THEM died anyway.  \n\n&gt; &gt; Bats don't have rabies all that often.  This is just a scare tactic.  \n\n&gt; False.  [To date, 6% of bats that have been \"captured\" or come into contact with humans were rabid.](https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/bats/education/index.html).  This number is a lot higher when you consider that it equates to ***one in seventeen bats***.  If the bat is *allowing you* to catch/touch it, the odds that there's a problem are simply too high to ignore.  \n\n&gt; &gt; You have to get the treatment within 72 hours, or it won't work anyway.  \n\n&gt; False.  The rabies virus travels via nervous system, and can take ***[several years](http://rabies.emedtv.com/rabies/rabies-incubation-period.html)*** to reach the brain depending on the path it takes.  If you've been exposed, it's NEVER too late to get the treatment, and just because you didn't die in a week ***does not mean you're safe***.   [A case of a guy incubating the virus for 8 years.](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1002/%28ISSN%291531-8249)  \n\n&gt; &gt; At least I live in Australia!\n\n&gt; [No.](http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/ohp-rabies-consumer-info.htm)\n\n&gt; Please, please, PLEASE stop posting bad information every time this comes up.

I came across this veteran who was in his early 50’s and had developed early onset dementia of Alzheimer’s type. Within a couple of years he went from forgetting simple things (like you know, when you go into another room and say “I know I came here for some reason” and then you can’t remember it) to getting lost in his own cul-de-sac. It really is terrible, devastating to his wife and kids and profoundly saddening for his care providers (like I’ll never forget, I’ve forgotten a lot of other things; this, I’ll take to grave with me).",

But it's important that you both receive this message because its obviously for a reason that I've stumbled across both of your comments:\n\nI'm so sorry. I don't know if you've heard of a more recent discovery/breakthrough with dementia/Alzheimer's. I've actually shared this with people who have been able to use it and have remarkable results.\n\nIt's not a cute, but it's a neat little remedy. They've found a link between music and memories and if you're able to get your hands on a pair of high fidelity over the ear headphones that can play really good hugs and lows and bass. You put them on her, once you've explained what you're going to try. And if you can play some of her favorite music from when she was a youth or young adult. There's this crazy thing that happens, but almost like magic, memories and cognition become almost perfect.\n\nSome people experience short bursts of normalcy, whereas for others this works as some sort of neurological remedy over time. With more and more \"exercises\" it stimulates a part of the brain that helps the misfiring and improves cognition.\n\nPersonally I've seen it work with at least 5 people. And it's breathtaking, life changing, and literally one of the most beautiful gifts I have ever been able to share with people who weren't aware of this. So please, try it. I'm going to search for a YouTube video that introduced me to the method. And maybe it'll help you and your family through this difficult time. I really hope your try it, what have you got to lose?\n\nI think even more, it's a gift that your grandmother deserves. She's been through so much. And this way, she can possibly get some joy in these final years before she says goodbye. Let me know if you try. I love hearing all the amazing things that come from this experience. And make sure to spread the word. We need to make this common knowledge so that people just automatically know to do this.",

I've actually shared this with people who have been able to use it and have remarkable results.\n\nIt's not a cute, but it's a neat little remedy. They've found a link between music and memories and if you're able to get your hands on a pair of high fidelity over the ear headphones that can play really good hugs and lows and bass. You put them on her, once you've explained what you're going to try. And if you can play some of her favorite music from when she was a youth or young adult. There's this crazy thing that happens, but almost like magic, memories and cognition become almost perfect.\n\nSome people experience short bursts of normalcy, whereas for others this works as some sort of neurological remedy over time. With more and more \"exercises\" it stimulates a part of the brain that helps the misfiring and improves cognition.\n\nPersonally I've seen it work with at least 5 people. And it's breathtaking, life changing, and literally one of the most beautiful gifts I have ever been able to share with people who weren't aware of this. So please, try it. I'm going to search for a YouTube video that introduced me to the method. And maybe it'll help you and your family through this difficult time. I really hope your try it, what have you got to lose?\n\nI think even more, it's a gift that your grandmother deserves. She's been through so much. And this way, she can possibly get some joy in these final years before she says goodbye. Let me know if you try. I love hearing all the amazing things that come from this experience. And make sure to spread the word. We need to make this common knowledge so that people just automatically know to do this.",

There are scams happening NOW where people are targeted and their VOICE is deep faked, and used to create a pleading recording of them saying they've been kidnapped and ransom money needs to be paid. With facebook it's easy for the scammers to choose upper middle class older people, see who their adult children are, and scam them. \n\nIt happened to my aunt and uncle while I was visiting them a few months back. They got a call from \"kidnappers\" asking a ransom for my cousin, and when my uncle put the phone on speaker, we could all hear my \"cousin\" asking for them to pay the people $10,000 to release him so he wouldn't be hurt, and not to call the police. He has a distinctive voice - we ALL heard it, and ALL were fooled by it. Luckily as my uncle was waiting in line at the bank to withdraw the money from their retirement fund, as I was calming my auntie down, I googled the circumstances to try and see what the rate of successful release was for kidnappings like this, and saw an article about this exact setup. That's when I got the idea to call my cousins phone. He picked up, was doing fine, and certainly hadn't been kidnapped.",

She called my ex (now her husband) at work. He had to call in someone to replace him at work to come home. My mom and the step mom took off to the police station to find my daughter. She wasn't at the station in the town where they live, so they went to the neighboring town's station to try to find her there. Both stations had never heard of my daughter and no reports on accidents that morning. They told my mom and the step mom it was probably a scam/hoax. To be sure, they stopped at my daughter's place of employment and she was there. There was no accident and she'd been at work all day. We were all freaking out and upset for a couple of hours while it was going on. I'm so glad that no one tried to gather money up. But, my parents said it sounded EXACTLY like my daughter's voice!",

Know that everyone wants to help with your pain even if they're bad at it... \n\nSo... take this for whatever it's worth to You- one thing that has helped me is the thought that regardless of religious beliefs or otherwise- your loved ones do live on in you. They helped shape who you are and their spirit and mind lives on in yours. Let their memory and love continue to guide you and they will never truly be gone.",
