"In the US It is known as death with dignity - formerly known as assisted suicide. it’s a combination of medications at lethal doses that they drink, which includes opioids to suppress the respiratory system (usually morphine), digoxin to slow down and eventually stop the heart, something to put you to sleep quickly like Versed, Lorazepam for anxiety, anti nausea and further prevention of respiratory distress, and typically another heart med. There are a group of volunteer physicians working for DWD who tweak the medication regimen based off results. The patient has to be able to drink the liquid themselves even if it’s through a straw. If you can’t drink it on your own, you can’t use it. So people with progressive diseases like ALS have a tiny frame of time to work with as they eventually lose ability to swallow. Some people don’t die right away (but they generally don’t wake back up) if they have a generally strong heart/lungs, so it’s typical for the physician or a hospice nurse to be at bedside to continue helping with symptom management.

"So this video hit really hard for personal reasons. I watched and thought exactly that: this isn’t oddly terrifying it’s beautiful, and it’s normal, and it’s something we should all have a right to. What’s terrifying is that most of us won’t get this: we’ll get a slow decay, our loved ones will watch us rot and break down, it will hurt worse every day, our minds will stop working and drive us mad. Medical staff will help us with the pain to a certain extent, but they won’t help us make the whole ordeal shorter. In fact, if we get unlucky and fall on an especially cunty doctor, we could end up with a feeding tube stuck through our nose into our stomach, making the whole ordeal last even fucking longer. We should all have a right to choose a better way to go, but currently very few people do. Anyway I was ruminating on all this and then “holy shit is that terry motherfucking pratchett?”. Millenium hand and shrimp. I had no idea he was into this cause, what a legend. So then I went down a little rabbit hole of research and in case you’re wondering, no: his battle with the horrors of Alzheimer’s apparently didn’t end with him being able to choose his own death.

"I live in Oregon where assisted suicide is legal. Several years ago someone I knew who was terminal (and also happened to be British) reached out to me for help with the logistics of getting this set up. She had lung cancer with brain metastasis and the tumors were pressing down in a way that rendered her partially blind & unable to drive anymore. I drove her to her various appointments— to the doctors, the psychiatrist (part of the requirement to be granted assisted suicide), and the pharmacy to pick up the sleeping pills prescription that would be the lethal dose taken all at once. 

When the time came, I had the honor of being included in the small group of close friends and family to be present for her passing. It took place in a teepee on a pasture. There was a rug and a futon and paper bags of fresh lavender set up inside. Two hospice nurses were present to ensure there weren't any medical complications and to pronounce her. They opened up the capsules into a little cup of juice just like in this video, asked the exact same questions to ensure this was completely of her own free will, and as per law, she had to be the one to take the cup & ingest its contents. The entire thing took probably 10 minutes from last words to death. It was incredibly graceful and peaceful. Afterwards, everyone sat on the rug in kind of a circle with her body on the futon still at the head of the circle, and shared chocolate and wine while we told stories about how we knew her & shared memories of her. 

It was an honor and a privilege to be entrusted to help her, and even moreso to be entrusted to be present for this deeply personal and most vulnerable final moment of her life.

 Death and life coexist in this world, you cannot have one without the other. Death is natural. And I believe it’s a human right. 

I wonder why anyone would willing deny this to someone, if they are clearly suffering and have a terrifying death ahead of them. 

To those of you who think this is unnatural.. 
“Playing god” or whatever you see it as, I’d like to ask why this is considered “playing god” and forcibly extending someone’s life through treatment isn’t. 


Our medicine crossed the line of “natural” years ago. We now live long enough that it’s common to face serious, terrible diseases and states of suffering in elderly years.        We were never meant to live this long. I don’t understand how you could look upon someone who’s in terror and pain and suffering and deny them release.
Death is only natural. But our medicine has become too much about extending life, and not enough considering the quality of life. Maybe extending life isn’t always right.

"Comment from a previous thread on how Rabies feels. Not mine. It’s TERRIFYING. 

Rabies.  It's exceptionally common, but people just don't run into the animals that carry it often.  Skunks especially, and bats.

Let me paint you a picture.

You go camping, and at midday you decide to take a nap in a nice little hammock.  While sleeping, a tiny brown bat, in the ""rage"" stages of infection is fidgeting in broad daylight, uncomfortable, and thirsty (due to the hydrophobia) and you snort, startling him.  He goes into attack mode.

Except you're asleep, and he's a little brown bat, so weighs around 6 grams.  You don't even feel him land on your bare knee, and he starts to bite.  His teeth are tiny.  Hardly enough to even break the skin, but he does manage to give you the equivalent of a tiny scrape that goes completely unnoticed.

Rabies does not travel in your blood. In fact, a blood test won't even tell you if you've got it.  (Antibody tests may be done, but are useless if you've ever been vaccinated.)

You wake up, none the wiser.  If you notice anything at the bite site at all, you assume you just lightly scraped it on something.

The bomb has been lit, and your nervous system is the wick.  The rabies will multiply along your nervous system, doing virtually no damage, and completely undetectable.  You literally have NO symptoms.

It may be four days, it may be a year, but the camping trip is most likely long forgotten.  Then one day your back starts to ache... Or maybe you get a slight headache?

At this point, you're already dead.  There is no cure.

(The sole caveat to this is the Milwaukee Protocol, which leaves most patients dead anyway, and the survivors mentally disabled, and is seldom done - see below).

There's no treatment.  It has a 100% kill rate.

Absorb that.  Not a single other virus on the planet has a 100% kill rate.  Only rabies.  And once you're symptomatic, it's over.  You're dead.

So what does that look like?

Your headache turns into a fever, and a general feeling of being unwell.  You're fidgety.  Uncomfortable.  And scared.  As the virus that has taken its time getting into your brain finds a vast network of nerve endings, it begins to rapidly reproduce, starting at the base of your brain... Where your ""pons"" is located.  This is the part of the brain that controls communication between the rest of the brain and body, as well as sleep cycles.

Next you become anxious.  You still think you have only a mild fever, but suddenly you find yourself becoming scared, even horrified, and it doesn't occur to you that you don't know why.  This is because the rabies is chewing up your amygdala.

As your cerebellum becomes hot with the virus, you begin to lose muscle coordination, and balance.  You think maybe it's a good idea to go to the doctor now, but assuming a doctor is smart enough to even run the tests necessary in the few days you have left on the planet, odds are they'll only be able to tell your loved ones what you died of later.

You're twitchy, shaking, and scared.  You have the normal fear of not knowing what's going on, but with the virus really fucking the amygdala this is amplified a hundred fold.  It's around this time the hydrophobia starts.

You're horribly thirsty, you just want water.  But you can't drink.  Every time you do, your throat clamps shut and you vomit.  This has become a legitimate, active fear of water.  You're thirsty, but looking at a glass of water begins to make you gag, and shy back in fear.  The contradiction is hard for your hot brain to see at this point.  By now, the doctors will have to put you on IVs to keep you hydrated, but even that's futile.  You were dead the second you had a headache.

You begin hearing things, or not hearing at all as your thalamus goes.  You taste sounds, you see smells, everything starts feeling like the most horrifying acid trip anyone has ever been on.  With your hippocampus long under attack, you're having trouble remembering things, especially family.

You're alone, hallucinating, thirsty, confused, and absolutely, undeniably terrified.  Everything scares the literal shit out of you at this point.  These strange people in lab coats.  These strange people standing around your bed crying, who keep trying to get you ""drink something"" and crying.  And it's only been about a week since that little headache that you've completely forgotten.  Time means nothing to you anymore.  Funny enough, you now know how the bat felt when he bit you.

Eventually, you slip into the ""dumb rabies"" phase.  Your brain has started the process of shutting down.  Too much of it has been turned to liquid virus.  Your face droops.  You drool.  You're all but unaware of what's around you.  A sudden noise or light might startle you, but for the most part, it's all you can do to just stare at the ground.  You haven't really slept for about 72 hours.

Then you die.  Always, you die.

And there's not one... fucking... thing... anyone can do for you.

"Not me. But some other Redditor wrote this: 

Rabies.  It's exceptionally common, but people just don't run into the animals that carry it often.  Skunks especially, and bats.

Let me paint you a picture.

You go camping, and at midday you decide to take a nap in a nice little hammock.  While sleeping, a tiny brown bat, in the ""rage"" stages of infection is fidgeting in broad daylight, uncomfortable, and thirsty (due to the hydrophobia) and you snort, startling him.  He goes into attack mode.

Except you're asleep, and he's a little brown bat, so weighs around 6 grams.  You don't even feel him land on your bare knee, and he starts to bite.  His teeth are tiny.  Hardly enough to even break the skin, but he does manage to give you the equivalent of a tiny scrape that goes completely unnoticed.

Rabies does not travel in your blood. In fact, a blood test won't even tell you if you've got it.  (Antibody tests may be done, but are useless if you've ever been vaccinated.)

You wake up, none the wiser.  If you notice anything at the bite site at all, you assume you just lightly scraped it on something.

The bomb has been lit, and your nervous system is the wick.  The rabies will multiply along your nervous system, doing virtually no damage, and completely undetectable.  You literally have NO symptoms.

It may be four days, it may be a year, but the camping trip is most likely long forgotten.  Then one day your back starts to ache... Or maybe you get a slight headache?

At this point, you're already dead.  There is no cure.

(The sole caveat to this is the Milwaukee Protocol, which leaves most patients dead anyway, and the survivors mentally disabled, and is seldom done - see below).

There's no treatment.  It has a 100% kill rate.

Absorb that.  Not a single other virus on the planet has a 100% kill rate.  Only rabies.  And once you're symptomatic, it's over.  You're dead.

So what does that look like?

Your headache turns into a fever, and a general feeling of being unwell.  You're fidgety.  Uncomfortable.  And scared.  As the virus that has taken its time getting into your brain finds a vast network of nerve endings, it begins to rapidly reproduce, starting at the base of your brain... Where your ""pons"" is located.  This is the part of the brain that controls communication between the rest of the brain and body, as well as sleep cycles.

Next you become anxious.  You still think you have only a mild fever, but suddenly you find yourself becoming scared, even horrified, and it doesn't occur to you that you don't know why.  This is because the rabies is chewing up your amygdala.

As your cerebellum becomes hot with the virus, you begin to lose muscle coordination, and balance.  You think maybe it's a good idea to go to the doctor now, but assuming a doctor is smart enough to even run the tests necessary in the few days you have left on the planet, odds are they'll only be able to tell your loved ones what you died of later.

You're twitchy, shaking, and scared.  You have the normal fear of not knowing what's going on, but with the virus really fucking the amygdala this is amplified a hundred fold.  It's around this time the hydrophobia starts.

You're horribly thirsty, you just want water.  But you can't drink.  Every time you do, your throat clamps shut and you vomit.  This has become a legitimate, active fear of water.  You're thirsty, but looking at a glass of water begins to make you gag, and shy back in fear.  The contradiction is hard for your hot brain to see at this point.  By now, the doctors will have to put you on IVs to keep you hydrated, but even that's futile.  You were dead the second you had a headache.

You begin hearing things, or not hearing at all as your thalamus goes.  You taste sounds, you see smells, everything starts feeling like the most horrifying acid trip anyone has ever been on.  With your hippocampus long under attack, you're having trouble remembering things, especially family.

You're alone, hallucinating, thirsty, confused, and absolutely, undeniably terrified.  Everything scares the literal shit out of you at this point.  These strange people in lab coats.  These strange people standing around your bed crying, who keep trying to get you ""drink something"" and crying.  And it's only been about a week since that little headache that you've completely forgotten.  Time means nothing to you anymore.  Funny enough, you now know how the bat felt when he bit you.

Eventually, you slip into the ""dumb rabies"" phase.  Your brain has started the process of shutting down.  Too much of it has been turned to liquid virus.  Your face droops.  You drool.  You're all but unaware of what's around you.  A sudden noise or light might startle you, but for the most part, it's all you can do to just stare at the ground.  You haven't really slept for about 72 hours.

Then you die.  Always, you die.

&gt; Yes, *deaths* from rabies are rare in the United States, in the neighborhood of 2-3 per year.  ***This does not mean rabies is rare.***  The reason that mortality is so rare in the U.S. is due to a very aggressive treatment protocol of all bite cases in the United States:  If you are bitten, and you cannot identify the animal that bit you, or the animal were to die shortly after biting you, *you will get post exposure treatment*.  That is the protocol. 

&gt; Post exposure is very effective (almost 100%) if done before you become symptomatic.  It involves a series of immunoglobulin shots - many of which are at the site of the bite - as well as the vaccine given over the span of a month.  (Fun fact - if you're vaccinated for rabies, you may be able to be an immunoglobulin donor!)  

&gt; It's not nearly as bad as was rumored when I was a kid.  Something about getting shots in the stomach.  Nothing like that.  

&gt; In countries without good treatment protocols rabies is rampant.  India alone sees 20,000 deaths from rabies PER YEAR.  

&gt; &gt; The ""why did nobody die of rabies in the past if it's so dangerous?"" argument.  

&gt; There were entire epidemics of rabies in the past, so much so that suicide or murder of those *suspected* to have rabies were common.  

&gt; In North America, the first case of human death by rabies wasn't reported until 1768.  This is because Rabies does not appear to be native to North America, and it spread very slowly.  So slowly, in fact, that until the mid 1990's, it was assumed that Canada and Northern New York didn't have rabies at all.  This changed when I was personally one of the first to send in a positive rabies specimen - a raccoon - which helped spawn a cooperative U.S. / Canada rabies bait drop some time between 1995 and 1997 (my memory's shot).  

&gt; Unfortunately, it was too late.  Rabies had already crossed into Canada.  

&gt; There are still however some countries (notably, Australia, where everything ELSE is trying to kill you) that still does not have Rabies.

&gt; &gt; Lots of people have survived rabies using the Milwaukee Protocol.  

&gt; False.  ONE woman did, and she is still recovering to this day (some 16+ years later).  There's also the possibility that she only survived due to either a genetic immunity, or possibly even was inadvertently ""vaccinated"" some other way.  [All other treatments ultimately failed, even the others that were reported as successes eventually succumbed to the virus.](https://pandorareport.org/2014/05/01/no-rabies-treatment-after-all-failure-of-the-milwaukee-protocol/)  Almost all of the attributed ""survivors"" actually received post-exposure treatment ***before becoming symptomatic*** and many of THEM died anyway.  

&gt; &gt; Bats don't have rabies all that often.  This is just a scare tactic.  

&gt; False.  [To date, 6% of bats that have been ""captured"" or come into contact with humans were rabid.](https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/bats/education/index.html).  This number is a lot higher when you consider that it equates to ***one in seventeen bats***.  If the bat is *allowing you* to catch/touch it, the odds that there's a problem are simply too high to ignore.  

&gt; &gt; You have to get the treatment within 72 hours, or it won't work anyway.  

&gt; False.  The rabies virus travels via nervous system, and can take ***[several years](http://rabies.emedtv.com/rabies/rabies-incubation-period.html)*** to reach the brain depending on the path it takes.  If you've been exposed, it's NEVER too late to get the treatment, and just because you didn't die in a week ***does not mean you're safe***.   [A case of a guy incubating the virus for 8 years.](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1002/%28ISSN%291531-8249)  

&gt; &gt; At least I live in Australia!

I'm so sorry. I don't know if you've heard of a more recent discovery/breakthrough with dementia/Alzheimer's. I've actually shared this with people who have been able to use it and have remarkable results.

It's not a cute, but it's a neat little remedy. They've found a link between music and memories and if you're able to get your hands on a pair of high fidelity over the ear headphones that can play really good hugs and lows and bass. You put them on her, once you've explained what you're going to try. And if you can play some of her favorite music from when she was a youth or young adult. There's this crazy thing that happens, but almost like magic, memories and cognition become almost perfect.

Some people experience short bursts of normalcy, whereas for others this works as some sort of neurological remedy over time. With more and more ""exercises"" it stimulates a part of the brain that helps the misfiring and improves cognition.

Personally I've seen it work with at least 5 people. And it's breathtaking, life changing, and literally one of the most beautiful gifts I have ever been able to share with people who weren't aware of this. So please, try it.
