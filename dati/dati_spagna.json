For the state, once a person stops contributing, he is more profitable dead, so a society where euthanasia is accepted could socially promote an obligation/responsibility to commit suicide upon reaching a certain age. The Futurama suicide capsule could soon go from being a joke to a reality, especially now with the enormous group of people who will reach old age alone once the millennial generation, without children, retires.\n\nAs stated below, once we begin to consider that there are lives that are not worth living, we will increase the range of expendable lives, little by little. If we add the Malthusian environmental ideas of the people in power, it is very understandable to be against it.\n\nSo, I just gave you a reason without mentioning God, religion or divine causes. I hope you at least consider it.",

The first is that some people consider life something \"sacred\", and, therefore, an ethical aberration to attack life. And, not wanting to participate in this, it is perfectly understandable that they oppose public financing of this. Another possible point is the protection of possible victims of euthanasia, in the case of people classified as insane, who would be under the mercy of whoever is in charge of their health. It's not a simple topic at all, really.",

What they call liberalism is lowering taxes on things like public health and education, dedicating the taxes that they do collect and the institutions to inflate the companies in their clientele network (in the case of this lady, El Corte Inglés, Telepizza, Quirón, Florentino Pérez's companies...). They call \"free market\" a system that is nothing more than clientelism, and they call themselves \"liberal\" because it sounds more modern than \"conservative\", but they are not liberal at all.",

It is infanticide.\n\nWhat you abort is a process in your body, the pregnancy process. As your body is, you have total freedom to control it. Or are we also going to legislate there?

Specifically to the conservation of Christian-Catholic values.\n\nEuthenasia is still a type of suicide, when it is the same person who decides to carry it out, or kill the person, if it is decided by a third party. Both are serious faults (sins) according to Catholic values.\n\nOn the other hand, abortion is understood as killing the baby, which is killing, which is again a serious offense (sin) according to Catholic values.\n\nI am not saying that Ayuso is a practicing Catholic or a believer, far from it, what I am saying is that she defends the conservation of those values.\n\nWith this I hope, first, that I have not made a mistake in the analysis and, second, that I have clarified to those who do not understand this speech what what she says is based on.

I defend the right to euthanasia, and I do not make decisions, but if I did (doctor/judge), I would reject this type of aspiration, especially in bleeding cases. More than anything to protect the very right to euthanasia. You have to be very strict with the granting of euthanasia so that your detractors cannot find loopholes through which to attack you.\n\nSpecifically, euthanasia must be reserved for those diseases that are terminal (without a cure) and that cause an excessive death. Now the question is whether depression meets those requirements. Depression can be treated. Are there people whose treatment does not work? Yes. But there are also new treatments and we must analyze whether the health of the specific person with depression is getting worse and worse, without hope that a (new) treatment will change anything. The situation would have to be causing more and more suffering and although this specific case seems unlikely, I do not think it is impossible.\n\nIt's a tough question and I don't think there is an objectively best answer.",

In the middle of the fifth wave and beginning of the holidays, no one knew how to answer the dozens of doubts that appeared at each step of the process. Everything was happening for the first time. I was so afraid of not doing the right thing that I called many people \"And thanks to that I now have a good support network. I am grateful, I have learned a lot about myself.

It was an impossible topic to talk about with family or even with your doctor. It was illegal. I went to her house once a week, so I never hesitated. But the concept is one thing and doing it is another thing. You give the injection and close your eyes. It stuck with me. I'm a nurse and I'm used to sedating people in agony at home, but this is different. The whole family around and you are going to trigger that! They were calm, everyone was able to say goodbye. She was talking until the end. I cried many times the following days, but his words reassured me when he poked him: 'Stay calm, wherever I am I will be fine and we will surely see each other.

But nevertheless, in the end I have reservations when it comes to voting for PP, VOX or C's, since they are parties that at the minimum support things that I hate: bullfighting (example in Gijon: [https://www.elcomercio.es/ gijon/gijon-reactions-supression-feria-toros-begona-20210818161343-nt.html?ref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F](https://www.elcomercio.es/gijon/gijon -reactions-suppression-fair-bulls-begona-20210818161343-nt.html?ref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F)), religion, monarchy, etc. Is it so difficult to be right-wing in Spain, but at the same time deeply atheist, in favor of euthanasia or abortion and against the monarchy? We are only four people in the country with that mentality and are we not worth it as a fishing ground for votes?\n\nEDIT: Perhaps the closest thing to what I want, and based on your answers, would be a liberal party, possibly the most similar would be the US Democratic Party: [https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki /Partido\\_Dem%C3%B3crata\\_(United States\\_United States)#Ideolog%C3%ADa\\_and\\_internal\\_trends\\_of the\\_Partido\\_Dem%C3%B3crata](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki /Partido_Dem%C3%B3crata_(United_States)#Ideolog%C3%ADa_and_internal_tendencias_del_Partido_Dem%C3%B3crata)",

And if another hundred thousand think the same, there will be 100,000 votes for liberticians who have not been neutralized, they will come to power and affect our lives.\n\nOf course I respect each person's individual decision and I do not believe that voting is the most important thing, in the long term the important thing is to raise awareness, that people increasingly understand that politicians are often redundant and parasitic middle men, that A large part of the salary goes to the State and the return services do not correspond with much difference to what is extracted,... But in the short term I think it is important to neutralize the vote of the liberticides, which also in the worst case They aspire to monopolize information, end freedom of the press, indoctrinate, that affects the long term.\n\nIf you look at economic and individual freedom policies, the closest thing to liberalism in Spain is the PP of Madrid. Recently they are even signing proven liberals like Manuel Llamas or Juan Manuel Lopez Zafra, you will not find these types of people in other parties.\n\nAt the national level, the closest thing is Ciudadanos, although it is a superlight liberalism, it is what it is... The PLIB would not even take it into account, it is directed by an \"intellectual\" more concerned with theory than with practice. The PLIB program is science fiction for Spain, in fact it is not just that they hardly receive votes, it is that they have fewer and fewer, why do they continue with the training, to feel morally superior?\n\nAnd between Ciudadanos and the PLIB there is an extensive desert that leaves many of us orphaned. Maybe the problem is a lack of demand as they said in another comment, although I think there is a tendency, especially among youth, to rebel against the hegemony of the left in the traditional media and collective ideology.",

Look, they won the hearts of these people by lowering inheritance taxes where they governed with PSOE or PP and with their rejection of VOX, but let's be honest, everything came to a standstill in the end and we already know how Cs goes...\n\nNowadays it is easier to find liberal voters in other parties, especially PP, VOX (which both promise to lower taxes and proclaim freedom but then in both cases do the opposite, because they sell them to you as liberals and are conservative) and PSOE (one of the reasons why it is said that PSOE is right-wing).\n\nIt is curious how many liberals think alike but do not have a party that truly represents them. In my opinion it is an opportunity that Cs lost and I doubt they will recover it.",

In the US the Democratic Party is more similar to the PSOE than you would like to discover (some of its members could even be in Podemos. Like Sanders or AOC). In all countries of the world the \"liberal right\" parties tend to be conservative. This is not much of a surprise, since traditional liberal thought is so nineteenth-century and old-fashioned that it fits well with bullfighting, monarchy, and Sunday mass.\n\nI am left with the distorted image you have of the Democratic Party in the US. There is everything since in the US the two-party system gives rise to umbrella parties. But they have little on the liberal right, they tend much more towards Keynesianism and defense of the public. Look at the taxes that Democratic states in the US usually have and then come back.\n\n You may be confused by the translation of the term \"liberal\" they use to refer to them. But it has nothing to do with the meaning that we give to liberal. There they would call Pablo Iglesias \"liberal.\"\n\nIn most if not all countries in the world, someone who is socially progressive is usually economically progressive. Because you don't have to go through the neuron many times to understand that fair economic progress is necessary to obtain a fair society in everything else.\n\nSuch a match would be incongruous.

        "Testo del post": "It is undeniable that we are heading towards an increasingly egalitarian society. Technological, philosophical and political advances lead us to an ever-greater understanding of our environment. There are two types of people, politically speaking: those who are aware that we are approaching a better society and those who are not.\n\nAnd within these 2 visions we could catalog many other subdivisions, but I would like to focus on these 2 basic ones.\n\nPoliticians who are conscious tend to have ideas with a higher ethical bar. It doesn't matter where they are on the political spectrum. The fact that they know that change is going to occur makes them aware of the role they play in society.\n\nSomehow, those aware of change know that their decisions play an important role in the lives of their neighbors. Debates begin on changes in the means of electrical production, universal basic income, elimination of combustion engines, etc. They begin debates with proposals that could modify the behavior of society and lead us to a better world. Among these, the most adventurous, focus their efforts on making the evolution of society happen as quickly as possible, in any way.\n\nOn the other hand, those who are not aware that we are approaching a more egalitarian society are the politicians who put obstacles in the way of everything. For them, any change is a mistake that would lead to a huge gap in the public coffers and nothing is possible. Their position is to delay the current status quo and sometimes, the most clueless, even decide to go back a few steps.\n\nIt is easy to recognize and classify certain parties and politicians in the world into these 2 categories, if we look at countries with higher democratic standards.\n\nIn the case of Spain, I think it is clear that the right would be part of the unaware. The effort they make to delay the advancement of society is much greater than their effort to advance. The PP is strongly represented here. They move heaven and earth to eliminate advances like the recent [recent appeal against the euthanasia law.](https://www.ondacero.es/noticias/espana/motivos-pp-vox-contra-ley-eutanasia_202012175fdc4644904ac70001718953.html) They remain fully portrayed, as has happened on other occasions.\n\nIn the case of the clueless, obviously we have VOX. They want to go back to the golden years where there was only education for their children, so they can continue oppressing the poor for a few more generations. For this very reason [VOX is pleased with the measures recently taken in Hungary, ](https://mobile.twitter.com/vox_es/status/1407992542407299075) in addition to having such a controversial fascist reputation.\n\nCiudadanos seemed like a party aware of the change. For many it was precisely the option of the conscious on the right. But in Spain there is a serious problem with the unconscious, which they did not see coming.\n\nThe inheritance of the right is its main problem. Other rights in the world had to fight against fascism. Those rights were established with strong ideals. The right in Spain did not have this experience. It could have been that way, but a coup d'état with a dictatorship included ended the progress of Spain and the right that it could have been.\n\nThe coup d'état of those who are not aware of the change causes a stagnation in the growth of ideas. Corruption among those close to the regime, who distribute what they loot to the oppressed, is the normal way of life and these practices continue to be fashionable, even today.\n\nThose who are not conscious make decisions that affect their immediate life. They are not able to see society as an evolving entity. Any change is complicated or downright wrong.\n\nCountries with parties in government that are aware of change are among the most cited examples as best models of democracy under a capitalist system. These countries with liberal governments are capable of deciding more or less correctly on proposals that affect society or at least starting debates that lead to this. Some of these countries even include environmental or social issues in their school curricula that could be controversial in Spain.\n\nThe way I see this, it is as if the rights of other countries, being aware of their expiration date, wanted to exercise and guarantee their power on the path towards that more egalitarian society. They educate the new generations by further raising the ethical level of their citizens, but not too quickly, lest some unconscious people reveal themselves and start a revolution that ends in a coup d'état.\n\nThe scale is not fragile, as it has been forged after many wars. But no one knows what torque will cause it to fall suddenly again on either side.\n\nThis resistance to progress will take its toll. Countries capable of advancing",

                "Testo del commento": "You start from a somewhat simplistic premise, that change can only come from the political class. From that premise, what you say does make sense because those political sensibilities closest to liberalism expect that the changes come organically, from the bottom up. If you omit that, it is normal for you to see those who tend to reject too much state interventionism as retrograde people. Political leaders are influential but they are nothing more than another piece in the social fabric. Also influential are artists, journalists, intellectuals, social networks,... all of these can be influential without the need to be linked to a centralizing political party.\n\nAnd yes, the Spanish right is less progressive than the left, but the problem is that progressivism takes root in prosperous societies and extremism in impoverished societies. Being progressive is extremely easy, it is just a matter of will, of signing laws, but that has to be accompanied by realistic (and unpopular in the short term) measures that generate wealth so that citizens do not have needs and are sufficiently relieved to be open to progress. Economic prosperity is a prior step and if you blame the Spanish right for not being progressive you should also look at the Spanish left and its contempt for the problem of unemployment, its contempt for the risk of reaching critical economic situations if the country does not grow quickly enough, his idea that wealth is something already given and that you simply have to milk the cow and sign progressive laws. You mention the right of other countries, I imagine European, that do do it well, well look at the other side of the coin, compare the Spanish left with other European left that worry that the welfare state is supported by a reality solid and realistic economy based on economic freedom, not wishful thinking and short-termism.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Politicians who are conscious tend to have ideas with a higher ethical bar.\n\nShould intellectual honesty be included as a necessary condition to aspire to that ethical bar? For me, one of the most important things is to be transparent with the people you ask to give you power. And the way politics works, at least until today, the politicians who go far have all done so by largely renouncing their principles, they have had to adapt to what sells the most within their party and the discourse that the more votes it generates. They have had to give up intellectual honesty, that is a very low ethical bar.",

                        "Testo della risposta": "Absolutely no one on the left defends or has ever defended \"equality of results\", it is an unoriginal strawman. By \"equality\", in simple terms, the left means:\n\n1. The nonexistence of social, economic or political classes. The end of privileges because there is no one in one family or another.\n\n2. The effective equality of fundamental rights, within certain rational limits imposed by the law written by the people for the people.\n\n3. Equality in effective access to the material resources that each individual needs not only to cover their basic needs, but also to pursue their happiness, develop freely as a person and be able to freely choose their social roles, within material and technological limits. of their society.\n\nIs such a society absolutely good? No, there are always limits, but it is the best we can aspire to.\n\nIs it a desirable society? Yes, because when people have the freedom to develop themselves as they wish, to walk their own path, society as a whole functions better. Added to democratic control of the means of production, this leads to people being more comfortable in their work and reduces their anxiety and depression, increasing their productivity and reducing crime and other antisocial behavior. Because when people have their material needs covered, much of their suffering is avoided and crime is reduced again. Because the less important the social or economic status is, the greater the fraternity between people, reducing conflicts, making it easier to reach agreements and consensus. Because when social, economic or political privileges cannot be inherited, it is more likely that the people chosen to hold some power are based on merit and ability, which also answers the question about excellence.\n\nSince everyone would have access to the resources they need to achieve excellence in whatever they decide, no one would feel excluded from this system, except those whose ambition is to hoard wealth to hold power over other people.\n\nHow would it be implemented? Well, everyone has their answers. But it doesn't matter, just because something is difficult to do doesn't mean it shouldn't be done.\n\nWhat does it mean to disagree with a system like this? Disagreement is perfectly acceptable, wanting to reimpose heritable inequality or prevent people from accessing the resources they need is not, obviously.\n\nWhere does wealth come from? The wealth is already there, and it is produced by the poor themselves and the workers as a whole, it is a matter of distributing it better.",

When was the last time that science said \"it turns out that we had a wrong model, now we understand \"and has he turned back? I'm curious, because this is the part that I don't understand about the conservative mentality, why want to stop and reverse something, when generally that goes against science and progress? I'm talking about things like accepting homosexuality, climate change, etc... Things that conservatives don't accept...\n\nIt's something I've always wondered about.
