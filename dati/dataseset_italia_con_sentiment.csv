"I'm at work now, but as soon as I get home I look for the post of a friend of mine who passed away a few years ago and was loudly asking to MAKE EUTHANASIA LEGAL for cases like you.

I promised her I'll do what I can, sign while I can.

Here is her last very clear message where I highlight her request for euthanasia and the subsequent letter she wrote in our nerd group a few minutes later.

Thank you all for visiting me, for being great friends, and for all the wonderful memories. Thanks to Ale for today's idea and thanks to all of you for joining. I couldn't have grown up with better friends, even Tola!!! Ahahahahah 🤪 I believe in reincarnation, so I believe that we will meet again and it will once again be a pleasure and an honor. Meanwhile, Tola behave!!! 😂 Guys, earthly life is a game, sometimes a bit of a dick, but enjoy it as much as you can. And fuck vegans. I love you all from the bottom of my heart and whatever happens after death, I am sure that you will always be in my heart and that, in one way or another, I will always remember each of you.

Life is Beautiful.

**P.SS You FUCK support euthanasia!! Because, you see, when there is no cure or you are terminal, euthanasia should not, ever, be called suicide. Euthanasia, in these cases, is an act of clemency, mercy and, ultimately, kindness**.

I hug you all.

Ah!!! I told my mother to organize something like refreshments or something at my house after the passing away!!!! ☺

Ah!!! My house will be available for a few more months and I would like it to be used!!! Enjoy it, have a barbecue, a dinner with friends, a romantic dinner... it's available!!! ☺💞❤

And then the next morning she wrote this,

\*\*They gave me one option: I can ask to be permanently sedated in a combination of a powerful sleeping pill plus painkiller (usually morphine) for days until I die, essentially from starvation.

How horrible and cruel.

Guys, I know it doesn't affect you directly, but raise hell for euthanasia, and not with the ridiculous online petitions that only serve to collect emails...\*\*

Stefy, the signatures of our dirty dozen are yours :-(

Oh God, he's not entirely wrong, civil rights come with the economic and working well-being of a society, which then in turn also demands social well-being, and therefore greater rights.

The fact that in Italy there is greater attention to civil rights than in Libya is partly due to shared well-being. As a counter-proof we could take Canada or Finland, even wealthier, where civil rights are more talked about.

"For people with serious health problems for which there is no remedy and for terminally ill people, I am more than in favor of euthanasia.

Deciding to ""get it over with"" for other reasons (such as a disastrous economic situation, depression of any stage, other situations of existential suffering, etc.), I see euthanasia as supporting a ""solution"" that is totally irrational and somehow mentally lazy.

I understand the meaning of phrases like ""it's my life and I choose what to do with it"" or ""at least I can leave with dignity"", but it is not a way to deal with personal problems, whatever they may be. Furthermore, a person who indulges you (or even encourages you) to ""leave"", in my opinion, is a person who has no consideration for you. I understand very well what it means to be depressed or suffer existential crises, but as much as we want to be ""proud"" and maintain our dignity, we cannot ignore the fact that, above all indirectly, we send signals for help because the real need in these situations is ""get better"" and/or feel GOOD. I'm not the type who believes 100% that ""standard"" suicide or euthanasia (in this case) is selfish, but it must be said that actually and, objectively, it is a bit.

"Discussing with some users under this post, I understood that the mantra in the comments is: ""Did you drop your ice cream and are you sad? Ah, well, then euthanasia is the only solution""

Bullshit aside, there's nothing to laugh about here. I had given my opinion regarding euthanasia for people who suffer for PSYCHOLOGICAL reasons resulting in turn from depression (depending on the stage), existential crises etc.

EDIT: little introduction that I forgot to write. THE UNDERSIGNED IS IN FAVOR OF EUTHANASIA.

Before judging me without really knowing me (as many have done without thinking twice), I would like to inform you that the undersigned KNOWS WELL what the things written above mean and that the light at the end of one's tunnel of life can be seen even though it is still a long way off. far away.

My opinion was based on the fact that a person apparently no longer had the will to live and that therefore there could finally be a solution to his existential agony. Among various things, I tried to say that in any case we must try to improve ourselves and/or ask for a hand (even if the refusal of other people's help in these situations is understandable). Thinking of euthanasia as the definitive solution (**PLEASE NOTE: ALWAYS IN THIS CONTEXT**) is for LAZY people. I define this last sentence well, because I understand that it is not easy to transcribe it and that it may not be exactly easy to understand. By ""lazy"" person I don't mean someone who doesn't feel like doing shit in general, but simply someone who IGNOREs the possibilities of improving their life. Like the ""mantra"" I wrote at the beginning, people have said almost all kinds of things to me, thinking that I was against euthanasia in general, that for me people don't suffer and that I don't understand empathy.

Now. I understand being outraged by ""such an affront"", but first understand who you are talking to. To define myself, in exact words, as a ""pooping person"" because I do not ""accept"" euthanasia for those who suffer (so, immediately to generalize because perhaps it is convenient) is not for intelligent people since the undersigned could define you in the same way ""beings"" because you don't know that I have actually been through these things.

And speaking of ** EMPATHY **, for those who aren't aware, empathy does not mean RECOGNIZING and SUPPORTING others and their state of mind. Empathy means **UNDERSTANDING** and, where possible, **HELPING**.

Yep, **help**. Just as there are professional figures such as psychologists who help people not only to overcome the current problems that afflict them, but also to **PREPARE THEM FOR FUTURE PROBLEMS**.

Signing in favor does not give you the civil status of a ""model citizen"" or the classic ""I did my part!"". You have made your contribution in allowing \[HOPEFULLY IT WILL BE LIKE THIS ONE DAY\] something that would absolutely help many people, but that doesn't justify you not **helping**, where you can, others just because there 'is the ""final solution"". From the series: you chose the easy way out.

Let's be clear, no one asked to be born and life is difficult and senseless for EVERYONE. There is no ""yes or no"". But if we can try or try again to LIVE WELL, it's worth doing and if we can lend a hand to those who are (I dare say) less fortunate, let's do it. Why do we have to impose on ourselves this thought that those who suffer (ALWAYS REMEMBER THE CONTEXT) are destined to do so until their last breath? (about ""you have no consideration for people"")

"This referendum would change article 579 to:

> Against a person whose consent has been extorted by the offender with violence, threat or suggestion, or obtained by deception [613 2].

In this way euthanasia is practically decriminalized, ensuring that those who help the patient and those who administer the procedure are cleared of any accusation (unless the conditions clearly written in the article apply), the next step should be to recognize the euthanasia as a real practice in order to make it safer and more regulated.

I understand it, even if it is not easy in the case of a terminally ill patient.
But once you've given the green light, how do you draw a clear line of demarcation?

An athlete who remains quadriplegic following an accident could argue that his life is no longer worth living.
A person who falls into depression, a girl who experiences rape, a man who loses his job and finds himself broke: in all these cases these people could decide that life no longer makes sense.

And, as in the case of a terminally ill patient, who are we to decide for others?

In general I consider myself in favor of it, but I am frightened by the possible consequences of such a law (because yes, we know that, once things are normalized, cases like those described above would arise).

Another thing I wonder is how much the use of the term euthanasia plays a role, on a psychological level, in place of something more frank and evocative such as ""suppression"" or ""culling"".

"1. That's absolutely not true. Personally, I am not terminally ill, but many people I know (myself included) are in favor of euthanasia because the idea of ​​having to find yourself in an incredibly shitty situation where you are destined to suffer for months and months and then die with certainty is still scary. absolute.

2. It doesn't matter who promotes the idea, but the idea itself. Hitler cared about animal ethics, but it's not like we can throw it all away just because Mr. Adolf tended to spout extremist bullshit.

3. ""Pitiful"" cases that can potentially happen to any of us. And there has always been profit for any bullshit, just think of the fake support of the LGBT community by multinational corporations. It's not like we're revoking their rights because someone is making money off of them. I don't deny that euthanasia can potentially lead to a small profit problem, but it certainly does not justify the total prohibition of the possibility of euthanasia for those who really need it. At this point we directly abolish all prisons because statistically a couple of people out of millions have been unjustly incarcerated.

4. These regimes attacked various minorities who certainly did not want to die and were not suffering and dying. You certainly can't compare it to people who beg and beg to die a little sooner if the only alternative for them is to live a couple more months in excruciating suffering.

5. Huh? I'm honestly confused, I don't know what you mean by this point.

>Do you want the art. to be repealed? 579 of the penal code (murder of consent) approved with R.D. 19 October 1930, n. 1398, paragraph 1 limited to the following words «imprisonment from six to fifteen years.», paragraph 2, in full and paragraph 3 limited to the words «They apply»?

This will be article 579 of the penal code

>Whoever causes the death of a man, with his consent, is punished with imprisonment from six to fifteen years. The aggravating circumstances indicated in article 61 do not apply. The provisions relating to homicide \[575-577\] apply if the crime is committed: 1) against a person under the age of eighteen; 2) against a mentally ill person, or who is in a condition of mental deficiency, due to another infirmity or due to the abuse of alcoholic or narcotic substances; 3) against a person whose consent was extorted by the culprit with violence, threat or suggestion, or obtained by deception \[613 2\].

"> If that's the only way to get it over, so be it

Sorry, but either I have become stupid, or there is something wrong with how the referendum question is posed based on the regulatory intent that one would like to achieve.

The law in question typifies with specific discipline, which prevails over the general one, a case of voluntary homicide to which a lesser penalty is applied than standard voluntary homicide (similar to the case of the crime of infanticide in conditions of moral or material abandonment) .

It is not a law that makes something criminally relevant that otherwise would not be, therefore its repeal would not decriminalize it.

The law limits itself to typifying a criminally relevant case, already provided for in a more general law, and provides for a different penalty range for this specific conduct, which is a subset of conduct that is already criminally relevant.

If we remove these provisions which enunciate a different punishment, effectively eliminating the specific discipline of consenting homicide, which is a discipline more favorable to the criminal, we are certainly not going to decriminalize but the exact opposite, we cannot do anything other than apply the general provisions on voluntary homicide and I see no other possibility of interpretation.","['law', 'homicide', 'would', 'specific', 'discipline']",2021-04-18 17:36:44,"{'neg': 0.147, 'neu': 0.79, 'pos': 0.063, 'compound': -0.967}",negative

"The detailed reasons that led to the rejection of three of the eight referendums that were presented and discussed on 15 February have been published [on the Constitutional Court website](https://www.cortecostituzionale.it/default.do).

# Euthanasia

As regards the question on euthanasia ([sent. 50/2022](https://www.cortecostituzionale.it/actionSchedaPronuncia.do?anno=2022&numero=50)), as already anticipated, the problem would lie in the lack of ""protection minimum"" to the right to life that would result in the case of abrogation of the crime of murder of a consenting person.

Now, the Court specifies first of all that the request for a referendum is an act without motivation, and therefore in judging whether it is admissible or not one must look only at the proposed text, and not at any declarations of any kind from the promoting committee:

>As this Court has clarified, «the referendum request is an act without motivation and, therefore, **the objective of the signatories of the referendum must be deduced** not from the declarations possibly made by the promoters \[...\], but exclusively **from the purpose ""incorporated in the question""**, i.e. from the purpose objectively obtainable based on its formulation and the impact of the referendum on the regulatory framework of reference \[...\]».

Having said this, what does the referendum say? This proposed to target the crime of murder of a consenting party ([art. 579 c.p.](https://www.brocardi.it/codice-penale/libro-secondo/titolo-xii/capo-i/art579.html)), appropriately cutting out some parts in such a way that this was punished (with the provisions relating to 'normal' murder) *only* if the victim was a minor, a person in a state of mental deficiency or whose consent was extorted with violence or deception; thus remaining silent on the remaining cases, after the repeal.

For the Court, this would mean that, following the repeal of the crime of consenting murder, *any* killing of consenting people would become legal:

>The objective result of the success of the referendum initiative would therefore be **that of making the killing of a person with the person's consent criminally lawful,** outside of cases in which the consent is invalid due to the incapacity of the person offended or due to a flaw in his training.

This also outside of just cases of euthanasia:

>In light of the resulting legislation, the ""liberalization"" of the fact would regardless of the reasons that may lead to requesting one's own death, **which should not necessarily be linked to a body prisoner of a state of illness** with particular characteristics, being able to also connect to situations of discomfort of a completely different nature (emotional, family, social, economic and so on), up to the mere taedium vitae, or even to choices that imply, in any case, the acceptance of one's own death at the hands of others .

The defense of the promoting committee, according to which this is not true because the only possible consent in such a situation is still that given in a medical context according to a procedure already defined by law, was rejected on the grounds that, when the murder of the consenting person is abrogated for all cases, then there is no longer an obligation to subordinate the validity of the consent to that procedure, which therefore could be given in any form, for any reason:

>Given the limitation of the criminal relevance of the murder of a consenting party only to the hypotheses expressly indicated by the current third paragraph of the art. 579 cod. pen., **nothing would authorize us to believe that the exemption from liability remains subordinate to compliance with the ""medicalized procedure""** prefigured by law no. 219 of 2017 for the expression (or revocation) of consent to therapeutic treatment (or refusal thereof).

Finally, after having once again underlined that what the promoting committee thinks is worthless (and in particular the fact that the referendum only serves as a push to induce Parliament to legislate), the Court justifies its power to intervene.

In fact, although it is true that the admissibility judgment should not be a preventive check of constitutional legitimacy on the legislation that would result following a yes victory, it is also true that the Court cannot admit questions that would undermine the minimum constitutionally guaranteed protection of some fundamental rights, such as the right to life in this case:

>Subsequently, sentence no. 35 of 1997 also referred this last hypothesis to those «ordinary laws **the elimination of which would lead to the suppression of a minimum protection** for situations that require such protection according to the Constitution» \[...\].

Of course, this does not mean that the crime of consenting murder is the *only* possible way to protect life.

There was a study behind it, involving legal experts).
For anyone who thinks that what is supported by the Constitutional Court is the most correct interpretation possible, in reality in my opinion Cappato brings some very strong arguments to question the court's justifications.

In particular, for example on the cannabis referendum, the Court makes extensive use of references to international treaties, but Cappato points out that although other countries have signed those treaties, they have still legalized those substances (cannabis, but also coca leaves, for example ). And they have had no problems whatsoever with the rest of the world following legalization.


Personally, I too have difficulty not seeing political will behind it after Amato's press conference and despite the fact that legalization has already taken place in other countries.

>\[...\] as referendums that affect not only the laws authorizing the ratification of international treaties, **but also those strictly connected to the execution of the treaties themselves, must be considered precluded.**

Evidently the constitutions of other countries do not have this limit, or in any case the validity or importance of international treaties could be severely reduced compared to Italy.

Yes and no.

This referendum aims to lift the absolute ban on doctors causing patient's death, in any case a doctor actively causes patient's death should be convicted of murder. If this law were to pass, it would become possible for doctors to even stop treating a terminally ill patient, which is currently prohibited.

The law on euthanasia is already required after the ruling in Cappato by the Constitutional Court, but without this step a situation like the one in Switzerland would be created (the doctor prescribes the drug but cannot administer it, because it would be murder). Therefore it does not directly allow euthanasia but simplifies the legal process by removing one of the main limitations.

Depending on how you want to legislate euthanasia or not, we could talk about assisted suicide (therefore without serious pathologies), but I see it as hard for everything to pass in one fell swoop. After this referendum we will be able to talk about the possibility for doctors to pull the plug even without a living will, perhaps even the possibility of voluntarily causing the patient's death (if authorized) depending on which side the parties take, but not about assisted suicide.

The purpose of the referendum is to change the law to remove the obstacle, then it is up to the parties to make the new law.

"It's important to focus on the here and now. Cappato explains well that euthanasia is a serious process, so there is a lot of multi-sectoral work in which various professionals make sure that the individual's discomfort cannot be resolved in any way.
As he himself points out, there are cases in which people contacted him, but then he changed his mind because he realized that what she was missing was pain therapy, or therapeutic support from psychologists. If there is no way to resolve the issue, then I think euthanasia is right when there is no therapy in sight.

What we talked about last time was specifically euthanasia in the case of depression, which I don't agree with at all due to the simple fact that we certainly have therapies in sight, but they are not being exploited. Furthermore, Cappato himself underlines the importance of trying to resolve the issue in another way first, without therefore immediately complying with the desire of the person requesting euthanasia. I also agree with this position, while the other time we happened to discuss it, if I remember correctly, it seems to me that your position (or that of other users) was to respect the will of the person with absolute priority, therefore without try other solutions first.

""- A great export of films and TV shows, books and comics, singers and musicians, not only currently but especially considering the last decades. Our national TV is watched also in the neighboring countries, in all the Balkans and in Romania/Moldova

- Great diplomatic presence with foreign embassies, aids, political meetings, peacekeeping assistance and also weapons/military ships export

- Also big importance in the international scenario, we are member of G7 and G20 and we compose 11% of the European Parliament. We have a recognized blue water navy and we host many American nukes

- A language and a history studied by a lot of foreign students

- The Pope, head of the Catholic Church, practically lives in Italy

- Country with the highest number of UNESCO sites and fourth for foreign tourists, we also ""recently"" hosted an Expo in 2015

- Good results in the most popular sports and at the Olympics

Not that parliament needs to legislate to formulate better.

If the referendum is voted on, anyone who helps a person to die will simply be completely abolished.

"It's an article from a couple of weeks ago, but we're talking about the referendum on euthanasia for which the collection of signatures hasn't even closed yet, so it's more relevant than ever. The interview is with [Professor Flick](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Maria_Flick), president emeritus of the Constitutional Court.

In particular, Flick criticizes the rather ambiguous scope of the referendum, which *totally* decriminalizes the crime of murder of a consenting person: and therefore not only in relation to the medical field, but also in any other situation in which a consenting adult can ask another to end his life. Flick underlines the absurdity of maintaining unchanged the crime of aiding suicide (which the Constitutional Court has only partially annulled, restricted to patients suffering from unimaginable suffering), while at the same time the crime of murder of the consenting person, which he points out is in a certainly any sense *'more serious'* than simple aid to suicide would become legal.

Flick does not make predictions, but at the same time he does not deny the hypothesis that, due to these difficulties, the Constitutional Court may not authorize the referendum even though the target of five hundred thousand signatures has already been largely exceeded.","['referendum', 'Constitutional', 'Court', 'Flick', 'crime']",2021-09-15 10:36:45,"{'neg': 0.221, 'neu': 0.748, 'pos': 0.031, 'compound': -0.9948}",negative

"But if someone asks you to end his life, there are two possibilities:

- 1) or is unable to commit suicide (and generally a person who physically cannot take his own life may have reasonable reasons for desiring death: to be clear, those of the Cappato ruling)


- 2) or needs a psychiatric evaluation and therefore falls within the prohibition already contained in article 579

If someone clearly wants death (Hamlet style, so to speak) and is able to give it to himself, he certainly doesn't need to go through the murder of a consenting person.

If he wants a painless death he can make a request to the ASL which will naturally deny it to him, because there is no reason to comply with his request.

In my opinion we are nitpicking here. The desire to kill oneself either derives from great and motivated psychophysical suffering, or from mental disorders that can be treated with psychotherapy.

It's not that, with all due respect to Avvenire and friends, if the referendum passes, the Futurama-style suicide booths will open.


EDIT: Another case came to mind + two inaccuracies corrected

A person could ask his friend to kill him at home and therefore essentially cause him a painful death, because he could hardly give him a peaceful death (unless he is an anesthesiologist / doctor, etc.)

Pain for pain, the would-be deceased would sooner do things on his own and commit suicide.

If he cannot commit suicide we return to case 1.

"However, it is curious that they want to repeal almost the entire crime of murder of a consenting person ([art. 579 c.p.](https://www.brocardi.it/codice-penale/libro-secondo/titolo-xii/capo-i/art579. html)), but no one is thinking of repealing [article 5 of the civil code](https://www.brocardi.it/codice-civile/libro-primo/titolo-i/art5.html):

>Acts of disposing of one's body are prohibited when they cause a permanent decrease in physical integrity, or when they are otherwise contrary to the law, public order or morality.

After all, ***this*** is the article at the basis of everything: because normally infringing a right with the consent of those who can *validly* dispose of it is an absolute justification that eliminates any hypothesis of crime ([art. 50 c.p.]( https://www.brocardi.it/codice-penale/libro-primo/titolo-iii/capo-i/art50.html)), but this does not apply to the case of murder of a consenting party precisely because of that article of the civil code, which makes it illegitimate (and therefore *invalid*) to arbitrarily dispose of the body or to give one's consent to do so.

Therefore, as long as that article remains—even if it does not carry any punishment with it—disposing of one's body in such a way as to cause serious injuries or death (even through other people) will remain illegal: and the State will never be able to facilitate, support or even just frown upon such a practice, because in practice it would go against its own legislation.

"""As far as we know now, the girl had stopped eating and drinking... [...] It is not even clear whether Noa Pothoven was accompanied in her death by deep sedation...""

Maybe in this case it's different. But in the Netherlands there is a practice called *versterving*, which is not euthanasia - that is, a practice in which life is actively ended. But one in which you are left to die of consumption. That is, depriving the dying person of food *and* hydration. All under deep sedation, because dying without being able to drink must be terrifying. In the proper and translated sense.

I know this because the grandfather of an acquaintance of mine - terminally ill with cancer - was terminated in this way. He didn't want any therapeutic fury, but he had also apparently expressed a clear refusal of euthanasia. And yet... And since - apart from the tumor - he was of robust constitution, it lasted like a week. So much so that the guy-pain aside-there was some guy left, but he was killed!

Obviously not. Or rather, legal protocols and procedures were followed. However, if I understand correctly, it was the doctors who had decided / strongly advised the family members for this choice. My impression - from his story - was really that not even the family members had any say in the matter. The thing was presented as if it were a medical practice like any other.

Let me explain: the referendum, in case you didn't already know, affects the crime of murder of a consenting person ([art. 579 c.p.](https://www.brocardi.it/codice-penale/libro-secondo/titolo- xii/capo-i/art579.html)), which currently punishes anyone who kills a person with that person's consent (unlike all other situations in which a right is infringed with the permission of the person who holds it, in which case you are never punishable); it is then specified that the murder of a consenting person is punished as normal murder if it is committed against a minor or mentally ill person (incapable of giving consent), or if consent is obtained by force, threat or deception.

What would the Luca Coscioni Association like to do? If you read the text of the referendum before signing the proposal, then you will know that approximately 70% of this article would be repealed: only the part that says that normal homicide would be prosecuted in those three cases (minors, mentally ill, consent obtained fraudulently). But then where am I wrong? Because, for one thing, in another thread everyone downvoted me for giving the example of two American guys (an episode you may know) who had met on an online forum, the first with the fantasy of being eaten and the second of being a cannibal. You can imagine how it ended: in Italy the latter (the 'survivor') would be punished for murder of the consenting person... but after the referendum? That article of the penal code would basically no longer be there, after all. Yet it is not a case study of euthanasia.

On another thread they told me that in reality they do it on purpose to 'leave a regulatory gap', so Parliament will have to immediately fill it with legislation on euthanasia. But... are we talking about the same Parliament that the Constitutional Court, after the ruling on Cappato, had given **one year** to fix the crime of aiding suicide? Did a year go by in vain without them even starting the process to touch on that topic? If the referendum were to pass (ending up also touching on areas that have nothing to do with the medical one), I'm pretty sure that no less time would pass before even the *idea* of spending time plugging the holes created would arise. in the penal code.","['referendum', 'euthanasia', 'passes', 'would', 'murder']",2021-08-31 10:25:54,"{'neg': 0.179, 'neu': 0.756, 'pos': 0.065, 'compound': -0.9971}",negative

1. the referendum could have admissibility problems in the control carried out by the Constitutional Court;
2. in the event of a positive check, art. 579 would be almost entirely repealed, but it should still be considered that today the scope of this provision is largely restricted by the existence of articles. 580 and 575 c.p. (in the sense that the hypothetical repeal of any of these three rules would abstractly lead to an increase in the scope of application of the other two), and consequently I would expect application jurisprudential guidelines aimed at:

\- interpret extensively (to the extent this is possible in criminal matters) the art. 579 at nos. 2 and 3 which are partly relief clauses of the law (e.g. in n. 2 in infirmity or mental deficiency one could think of bringing back the simply depressed person who asks his friend with clear consent to shoot him in the head to help him );

\- broaden the scope of application of homicide 575, for example through a stringent interpretation of the concept of ""consent"" referred to in art. 579 and with strict requirements, so as to almost always exclude the existence of valid consent pursuant to art. 579 himself (e.g. my friend writes to me that he wants to die and that he wants to be shot in the head.

* ""su jualeddu"" = ""the yoke"" was a miniature of the yoke used for oxen. It had a ritual meaning and was used by all accabadores

* the lady, when she speaks in Italian, is clearly translating word for word from Sardinian (for those interested, it is a dialect of the Logudorese).

"End of life, Cappato accompanies a terminally ill Venetian woman to Switzerland, but not connected to cars, and therefore risks 12 years in prison again.

The former radical parliamentarian and treasurer of the association Luca Coscioni, who has been active for years in the battle for the legalization of euthanasia, once again accompanied a terminally ill patient to Switzerland, a Venetian woman afflicted with cancer.

This time, however, the politician risks 12 years in prison because, unlike some previous cases, the patient is terminal, but does not depend on life-sustaining treatment devices.

Consequently, in this case, assisted suicide would not be permitted, according to the Cappato/Dj Fabo constitutional court ruling of 2019, which precludes access to it for those who are not, so to speak, ""attached to machines"".

Presumably this new civil disobedience will bring him to trial again, perhaps with the aim of ""forcing his hand"" and extending the criteria to allow access to assisted suicide also to cancer patients, however this subjects him to the risk of a sentence of up to 12 years in prison.

"""We need new mobility"" no, even before that we need a new mentality of those who live in cities and those who administer them. Worse than not having cycle paths is having cycle paths made by those who understand nothing about them, which have the opposite effect of proving the detractors right. In various cities where I have lived I have seen tracks thrown there haphazardly because it's cool to do them but beware of pissing off the motorists, who have done more damage and caused more accidents than before and proved the detractors right ""well, you wanted the tracks and then this is the result. We were right not to want them.""

To re-establish Italian roads, we need processes that are a standard with stringent constraints to which no administrator can make changes. Standard that must be developed by those who are free from electoral pressure.

It makes no sense to have unprotected tracks with cars whizzing by, tracks that are interrupted or have diversions every 100 metres, pedestrian/cycle paths that are not interconnected and you are forced to travel through traffic and so on. The same road system and infrastructure should be designed to favor bikes first and then cars. I still remember when I lived in Viale Marconi (Rome) but I was forced to take a car or bus to reach EUR. I was literally less than 2km away, but it was absolutely impossible for me due to the shape of the roads.

But it also doesn't make sense how cities are expanding. If we really wanted to discourage the use of the car, the bike must always be convenient, at any time of day and for any activity. I have to be able to load it on the train without it being a nuisance, I have to be able to park it and walk around and then find it again, I have to be able to reach supermarkets, shops and other activities easily.

"Good morning friends, do you want to hear a story where the planets align to maximize bad luck?

At Christmas my company gives away, as a benefit, a 100 euro voucher that can be used in various shops. I chose Feltrinelli since I have a lot of books on my wish list. Two weeks* ago I decide it's time to spend these 100 euros, and I place a nice massive order, halving my wish list.

Since I knew that I would be in the office these days, and that the concierge is not at my house this week, I have everything delivered to my mother's house, what a notice (estimated delivery date: 15-18 February)

Last night I was about to go to sleep, when out of caution I decided to look at the status of the shipment. It appears delivered.

I then wrote to my mother to ask if GLS had passed, but she too wasn't at home yesterday. When you returned, you saw some packages thrown haphazardly inside the gate, but since you knew that my package would arrive later in the week, you thought they were packages from condominium owners. Evidently the courier didn't even wait for someone to answer the intercom (no one would have answered, because the house was empty), but she simply threw the packages over the gate (thank goodness I never order fragile things).

Oh well, no problem, you'll say: your mother could have gone out to collect the package last night and she died right there. With the only exception that yesterday, *for the first time in over two months*, it rained. While my package, with one hundred euros worth of books inside, sat peacefully outside in the elements.

"China is buying huge quantities of classical instruments, completely throwing the market into crisis and raising prices ridiculously.

Just the other day they placed an order for 6 million guitars (Ansa news) and most likely other instruments are also involved.

One of the most important wind instrument manufacturers in Europe has an absurd overbooking which has led to having to extend waiting times to almost 5-7 years from when an instrument is ordered and prices have increased by a good 20%.

Most likely, given the terrible European theater crisis, the classical market will little by little be moved to Asia, with already important European masters being called every year to give masterclasses in China, Korea and Japan.
Also of note is the cultural connection established between China and Italy where Chinese musicians constantly come here to learn bel canto completely paid for by the Chinese state.

He explains how although the disaster probably would have happened anyway because there's no shit anyway, too much water, the government spent a lot of money (billions of dollars) about ten years ago to prevent floods, but interventions had been made badly and vastly underestimated given that the flooded city was built in the bed of a huge river that was artificially narrowed.

In addition to various delays in institutional communications and the incompetence of some superintendents who were waiting for orders because they didn't know what to do even though some technicians (for example those from the metro) had asked for some things (trivially when the water started flowing they didn't do them stop, someone then made a mistake in not opening the doors causing the water to accumulate inside the subway cars even though it was much lower outside)

"1) leave the shower head alone, it's a ball. Get yourself a cappuccino maker with a round whisk on the bottom, they froth the milk which is a pleasure, it comes out nice and thick and above all consistent.

2) forget about the super-automatic ones, they are famous for their unreliability, as you have noticed: making the grinding system automatic involves a lot of moving components subjected to considerable mechanical stress which invariably do not last long.

I recommend a decent grinder and a separate espresso machine. Then you have to see how much you want to bother... since you're starting with the idea of ​​an automatic, I'll take it for granted that you don't want to bother too much, so I'd tell you to get one with a pressurized filter holder, which makes the results a lot more uniform.

I leave the advice to others on the models because since I finished my ""home bar"" station I have lost the desire to keep myself informed about market offers and therefore I am not very up to date.

If, however, you don't want to bother with anything, but want to maintain decent quality, a pod machine like Didiesse Frog could be right for you: if you buy online the pods cost less than the capsules, they don't lock you into a proprietary system and the quantity of parts moving is minimal, so they usually last forever.

"Good morning Ritalians.

I received a diagnosis of ADHD last year, as an adult in my late thirties, which changed my life (for the better) and I'm pretty sure my sister has it too (as well as various family members with whom I'm no longer in contact). contact). For those who don't know, ADHD has a heritability level equal to height, as a genetic trait, or around 79%, so there are often more people who have it in a family.

You have also already had several problems at school, in your personal life and some serious psychiatric problems, so I think it would be appropriate to evaluate this possibility - which is at least plausible - so that you can live better and have a more precise clinical picture of yourself. Don't give me the usual criticisms of medicines blah blah they're not good for you etc - also because knowing her she would be very cautious, and even just cognitive behavioral therapy with someone who understands it would be a panacea for her, if they give her a correct and serious diagnosis and they focus on the right elements! We have also already talked about it and you find yourself in many of the symptoms.

However, I live abroad and I was wondering if there was anyone here who can tell me the names of centers (edit: he lives in Northern Italy) that do the tests and which are serious or if there are some that you should stay away from, for example , so that you can carry out a particularly rigorous diagnosis or non-diagnosis process. I say particularly rigorous because you received a diagnosis of dyscalculia as a child and a personality disorder recently - you would therefore need someone with the courage to navigate a clinical picture that is perhaps not very easy or where perhaps incorrect or incomplete conclusions have been drawn in the past (even the co-incidence of personality disorders with ADHD is high, among other things, or one is diagnosed instead of the other due to oversights sometimes, so it all adds up a bit).

Let me know and thank you very much in advance!!!

Now, euthanasia is illegal here. Is it possible to wish to declare that you choose euthanasia in case of disease X and carry out this wish in countries where it is legal?

"Passive euthanasia (letting oneself die by disconnecting the machines) is permitted in Italy: it was already admitted 15 years ago in the Englaro case, but the law on living wills (law 219/2017) has definitively confirmed it. Today you can fill out provisions with which you decide, in the event that you find yourself unable to do so in the future, which health treatments you want to receive and which ones you don't. These also include life support through machines, so you can allow the doctor to disconnect them if you keep you alive, and let you die. If a person finds himself unable to express himself and has not filled in the DAT, the Englaro criteria always apply: it is possible to hypothetically reconstruct what you would have liked to have done (this post on Reddit, for example, could be very strong evidence).

Active euthanasia (asking the doctor to introduce a drug into one's body that causes death, because death does not occur on its own by disconnecting the machines, or occurs slowly and painfully) has been partially legalized by the ruling of the Constitutional Court on the Cappato case , but has not yet been regulated by law. Therefore, even in the cases admitted by the Court, someone must take it upon themselves to help you die (more precisely: kill you) and undergo criminal proceedings in which the judge should then acquit them because the fact no longer constitutes a crime. You cannot achieve this result with the DAT, because in them you can only decide which health treatments to support or refuse, you cannot make more generic expressions of will (""take me to Switzerland"").

In short, it all depends on the situation you find yourself in: an irreversible state with no hope of cure, kept alive by machines? You are ""lucky"" and can immediately let yourself die. Irreversible state but self-sufficient and capable of living for a sufficient time even without any health treatment? The path is much more tortuous. It is no coincidence that this absurd disparity in treatment for two situations that are actually very similar is the main argument on which the aforementioned unconstitutionality ruling is based.","['die', 'machines', 'law', 'health', 'euthanasia']",2022-04-18 10:51:09,"{'neg': 0.147, 'neu': 0.743, 'pos': 0.109, 'compound': -0.9735}",negative

In the long run, all this leads to having a population that is unable to survive without modern medicine, therefore to its decimation if the treatments it needs are no longer available (all civilizations sooner or later collapse), and therefore to the death of many more people than would have occurred if their ancestors with serious illnesses had not been treated.

Not only does this environment not reward prosocial behaviors, such as volunteering, but it actively stigmatizes and punishes them.

It goes without saying that the greatest predictor of this type of behavior is poor social capital. Exactly the Italian situation.

I have been a blood donor for about ten years, since university. Became regular over the last 5-6 years. I do a lot of sessions because I only donate plasma, which can be donated more often than whole blood, and this has voluntarily or involuntarily come up in casual conversations over the years. Let me tell you this: outside the blood transfusion centers my activity as a donor received **only blame**, I heard from multiple pulpits that I was ""stupid"" because ""it hurts"" and ""you're ruining your health"" and my vein could have ""burst"", that ""it is of no use"" because ""they sell blood"" and that the day the blood was useful to me I would have been ""left to die"". Honorable mention for an idiot who complained about the fact that plasma is used particularly in the operating room and that the hospital operating rooms were all ""full of southerners"" and that therefore donating plasma encouraged the ""southerners to come here to be operated on "". All this in Rome, not in the far north.
I saw the same social hatred directed towards an ambulance volunteer, who was accused in my presence of volunteering to ""get out of work"". I see the same hatred every day in all media, directed towards those who volunteer abroad or at sea.

Honestly, the only thing I wonder is how it is possible that homophobia is so widespread in Italy and how it is possible that there can be extremist groups that don't find themselves having to pay any penalty for all the shit they do in public. (from the advertising on abortion, to the League's support for the gaffe in Umbria on abortion, up to even the super questionable advertising on euthanasia, etc.). In my opinion there is very little to defend, also because the video contains false data, such as for example that LGBT+ people are already protected, that reported cases of homophobia are very few and that we will have to live in a new reign of terror so at the first gaffe you will be punished with prison, as if we were really in a dictatorial regime (all false things and denied by certain data).

"The video in question has already been discussed on another thread about ten days ago if I remember correctly. In any case, I'll try to give my very personal opinion: in my opinion when you ask yourself why there are so many homophobes, transphobics, but also racists in Italy, you are looking at the problem from the wrong point of view. The real question is: how were people formed who managed to overcome the barriers of prejudice and accept what is different?

For simplicity's sake, let's consider only the problem of homophobia: I am of the opinion that homophobia is an attitude that forms spontaneously in all communities that do not directly address the problem. The statement ""we are born homophobic"" may seem strange, but let's try to argue a little further...

My girlfriend's grandmother went to do a hairdressing course in Veneto in the 70s: she didn't have the slightest idea of ​​the existence of homosexuals. As soon as their teacher introduced herself, she sensed that ""something was wrong."" She was so ""feminine"", and she was actually very impressed, almost scared. Nowadays, she considers gays as some kind of fashion, and she always looks at them wrong, and yet no one taught her to be homophobic.

And here we are at the essence of my speech: what determines the formation of homophobia, transphobia and more generally racism is the lack of information and the failure to address such delicate issues on a continuous basis. I too was homophobic until I was 13, but then I started listening a little here, a little there, and then I realized how completely wrong I was. However, some reflection was necessary on my part, as a child no one taught me to have an open mind from this point of view. Only by browsing the internet did I understand how important the topic is and I changed my mind.

In conclusion: a society can overcome prejudices of any kind if and only if the topics in question are addressed on a daily basis, thus training the citizen.

Regarding the question of hindered freedom and other things like that, in my opinion it is not true: in principle any of us has the right to think and above all to say what we want, and certainly this law does not in any way hinder the freedom of a person certain category of people (which actually happens with the LGBT+ community according to several points of view in other contexts). Anyone can say what they want with the means they have, but then it is right not to complain about having been punished by the law.

This is fundamental because the person, regardless of everything, will still be able to say what they want, but this does not mean that this attitude must be hidden under the excuse of ""freedom of speech!!1!"": gratuitously offending a certain category of people without any valid reason, which among other things does not exist, puts their coexistence and their reputation within a society like ours at risk. The subjects in question ""have the right"" to harm people both verbally and physically without actually paying the consequences of their actions (or at least they do, but for other reasons and not always; I also remember the recent and umpteenth [ episode of homophobia](https://www.ilmessaggero.it/roma/news/coppia_gay_perseguetata_ogni_giorno_insulti_spinte_e_minacce_con_pale_e_bastoni-5302915.html) in Rome, for which we do not even know if the subject will, in fact, be punished).

"**What can we talk about at Christmas?**

You sit at the table with lots of people (mostly family members), for endless hours, and everyone wants to eat, drink and have fun.

But there is a pitfall that hides between a salmon canapé and a slice of panettone: the (inevitable) discussion, capable of transforming the best diners into angry hyenas ready to throw the plates after them.

Because the ""spirit of Christmas"" is just a thin veneer that falls off after a few taps.

How to do? If you don't want the discussion to degenerate and tempers to heat up, making Baby Jesus cry, you need to choose the topics that are as least *divisive* as possible and correct the rudder at the slightest sign of drift.

There is always a nostalgic grandfather or a pain in the ass uncle and a companion who gives you a lesson in *bon ton* before starting, but with a little preparation we will be able to propose the right safe, light and inconsistent topics to talk about with joy and enjoy the holy holidays and the Russian salad.

*Topics to avoid:*

* politics: internal, foreign, past (absolutely out)
* taxes and duties (there are always those who don't pay them, etc...)
* ecology (""they throw it all together anyway"")
*immigration (for God's sake)
* civil rights: euthanasia, gay marriage, etc
* catastrophes, mortality, diseases
* sex (with reservation)

*""Safe for XMas"" topics*

* history (the more remote, the better. Babylonians are fine)
* work (but without controversies about chronic shortages, deductions, pensions, security and all those boring topics)
* various anecdotes, real or invented, to be brilliant
* cooking, wine, beer
* hobbies (DIY, decoupage, etc.)
* music (but not *trap* for reasons of appetite) films, art in general

"Hi guys, a ""friend"" of mine, so to speak, brought my attention to the case of [Chiara](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiara_Corbella_Petrillo).

A TL;DR is that this woman had the terrible misfortune of having two pregnancies with severe birth defects. In the first the anencephalic child (without a brain, he would certainly have died), in the second there were serious malformations and lack of limbs; Both died after 9 months of pregnancy and childbirth (I believe the reluctance to have an abortion is due to a religious background, so much so that she is now blessed).

Then, finally, during a smooth pregnancy, the couple has a healthy baby, and the woman discovers she has carcinoma. She decides to carry the pregnancy to term and then go to therapy.

I didn't feel like discussing the matter with this acquaintance of mine with whom I'm not comfortable discussing certain things, so I turn to you anonymously to understand what you think and to discuss the ethics of the matter.

Without unnecessarily leading to eugenics, in my opinion I find the idea of ​​treating all life as unique and untouchable, to then prolong the suffering of a fetus destined to die, not to mention the suffering brought to family and loved ones ( obviously the suffering of these is a minimal percentage, but still significant, in my opinion).

I am not a mother (male and perhaps childfree), so I cannot understand the suffering of this thing, but I find that the whole story is a bit obscured on a media and face-value level. I think it is important to discuss these things, and the choice made during the third pregnancy is a personal and important choice, but this does not take away the stubbornness in wanting to bring lost pregnancies to term, in the hope that they are a *sign* or a plan*.

"The topic is very delicate and controversial, in this regard I can tell you the story of a couple of acquaintances of my parents who had two children with severe and almost total disabilities 3-4 years apart, the first child is blind and in a wheelchair , 100% not self-sufficient and with a serious mental handicap (perhaps he understands something but does not speak) while the second is practically in the same conditions but communicates even if with great difficulty (let's say he realizes his situation).

The first child was a surprise but with the second having done additional tests (we're talking about almost 30 years ago) they immediately realized that things weren't going well and proposed an abortion to the mother, the latter finding themselves at an unthinkable crossroads. they felt it and continued the pregnancy.

The situation is what it is, years pass and one day the second son, now a teenager, says to his father crying (I won't report the precise words but the gist of the speech, paraphrasing, is):

*""I would like to die, I can't take it anymore, I live a shitty life and no girl will ever want me, I will never know what love is and I will die alone in an institution when you and mother are no longer here""*

The parents had to go into treatment for quite a few years to recover from those words, it can't be easy to hear certain phrases said and somehow feel unfairly guilty for having contributed to that situation.

Logically here we are talking about very serious disabilities, in the case of the second child we are talking about living in the dark, with an unresponsive body and with the ability to understand what is happening but with the difficulty of expressing oneself.

"I know Chiara's story well and I also attended a testimony from Enrico, her husband

I would like to point out that at the beginning it seemed that the second son, Davide Giovanni, would only be malformed and therefore would be able to live but in a wheelchair etc., while only later did they learn that he would not be able to live

Considerations:

First of all, I think it is a *very* easy question to trivialize and deal with superficially, it is already a thorny topic in itself, and let's also add the context of faith

I don't know about prolonging the suffering, that is, I don't know if the first two children actually ""suffered"", to tell the truth I hadn't even asked myself that.

Edit: on the suffering of family and loved ones you can read and see various interviews, they certainly shared a suffering in history, but they did not distance themselves and I think they share the joy


Having said that, I think that these things should be treated in a personal manner so as not to diminish the suffering of others; that is, Chiara and Enrico lived, amidst the difficulties, this story with great joy, which was also seen in her story and shines through in the book. However

- This does not mean that cancer is a beautiful thing or that if you have cancer you have to be happy because she was happy, taking a difficulty as a ""gift"" or ""opportunity"" is a very personal thing, you cannot tell it to another “come on you have cancer but it's a gift”
- Enrico himself says “it's not that Chiara was pissing holy water”; and in the midst of everything you can imagine how much pain and difficulty in dealing with such a story on a daily basis

Obviously the whole story if you don't see it from a faith perspective is almost grotesque; However, in a certain context, Chiara's story has become ""bigger"" than herself: I personally have received a lot from her story, as have others I know, and this is difficult to see from the outside

From a Christian perspective, apart from the ""transitory"" suffering (that's not saying much!), Chiara's story is joyful; that is, for those who believe it, Maria Grazia Letizia and Davide Giovanni went to the Father, as did Chiara
That is, for a Christian in some way life serves to become saints, death is a passage, just look at [how they sang at the funeral](https://youtu.be/R2txA2y3oB0)

I conclude even if I haven't been very exhaustive on my thoughts by linking Chiara's [book](https://www.amazon.it/dp/8827010157/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_8cmsFbC226A71), written by friends; obviously it has a faith reading of history, but it also tells of the suffering and difficulties","['story', 'suffering', 'know', 'Chiaras', 'also']",2020-08-28 08:47:52,"{'neg': 0.11, 'neu': 0.711, 'pos': 0.179, 'compound': 0.9913}",positive

Unfortunately you are right, sometimes some things like cancer or other suffering are seen in an ""objectively"" good light: You are suffering because you are important and because you will grow after these difficult times. it's a fairly narrow perspective which in my opinion is instilled a little too much, and the many people who don't share it are often seen as ""negative"" (after a couple of miscarriages it seems normal to me that a person is reluctant to try again ).

"From my point of view, whether it is an embryo, a fetus or the mother, they are all lives and as such must be respected. A woman should ALWAYS have the possibility and the means to choose whether to carry on with a pregnancy or not, but a child must not come into the world if it is not loved or wanted, if the mother for religious reasons does not want to abort it or keep the child in newborn adoption.
As regards the birth of children with health problems such as genetic diseases or malformations, that is an extremely complex issue which I sometimes also wonder about, but generally I think that prenatal screening should be mandatory for genetic diseases and Down syndrome and that if they test positive and the mother does not want to abort her child's future care is not within the NHS, at least for those diseases that prevent sufficient cognitive capacity and autonomy in adult life.
Abortion must be an awareness of one's own life, that of the unborn child and of society. From the moment they are conceived until their death, a person influences everyone around them, if you don't love or don't want a child you shouldn't bring them into the world, if you don't have the means to support them financially even without welfare systems they shouldn't come to the world, if his survival beyond the life of his parents is linked to people who have not had the opportunity to consciously choose his birth he should not come into the world, if he does not physiologically have the possibility of experiencing the world as a healthy person and of contribute to society does not have to come into the world. In the third millennium it is absolutely unacceptable that there is still a dialogue on the abortion of unwanted children, contraceptive methods are effective, widespread and accessible to all and religion is NOT an excuse for one's personal choices. Life is respected by trying to reduce to the minimum possible the suffering and inconveniences that people may experience in their lives, but if your choices lead to your suffering, to that of children who came into the world in prohibitive health or economic conditions, people and of the society that are influenced by this new life, then the right to life ceases to be such.","['world', 'life', 'child', 'come', 'mother']",2020-08-28 09:22:13,"{'neg': 0.095, 'neu': 0.838, 'pos': 0.067, 'compound': -0.8966}",negative

How do you subordinate a life, a person, to the fact that his family can support him financially?
You combine the right to life with an economic/utilitarian goal, this is worthy of the worst dictatorships in history and the present.

Forgive the categorical judgment but we are going crazy here

Do you have an idea of ​​the false positive and false negative rates of non-invasive tests for Down syndrome?

Do you know the incidence statistics for Down syndrome as a function of age? Do you know that amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling have between 1 and 2% chance of causing an abortion?

The mere idea that someone thinks that the value of people can be calculated with their economic productivity makes me shudder.

"Let me start by saying that I am against abortion, at least because it is better to die a natural death (even if sedated) rather than a self-inflicted death (getting killed). An embryo (even pre-embryo or whatever you want to call it), according to the laws of nature, proceeds to live and evolve until it is killed (or dies of disease). Therefore the Chiara case is morally legitimate (letting the anencephalic patient live until she dies for biological reasons, although it is right to use medicine to reduce suffering), just as her choice to continue the pregnancy at the cost of risking her death is legitimate. skin (the unborn child is not guilty of still being alive, and therefore should not be executed). If faith is also involved in the whole matter, the matter becomes more complicated because some people are really allergic to anything that even has a vague Christian smell (they make much less fuss when there is some bizarre and exotic religiosity involved) . However, we are still alive here and we can have a discussion because in the months before our birth no one decided for an abortion.

The problem lies in the people (and in the poor coincidence between ""legal"" and ""moral""): if they _decide_ that they want abortion (or if they just have an opinion clearly in favor of abortion), no reasoning and no scientific data will be able to convince them . For example: born prematurely at just over 20 weeks are they now successful adults with a life worth living, while others were aborted at 23-24 weeks? He doesn't care.
