So obviously it's an interesting vision among other visions of things and it's interesting to talk about it.\n\nHowever, I am an atheist (agnostic when I am in a good mood), so death has nothing sacred, suffering from an incurable illness leads to absolutely nothing, being dependent in all your daily tasks is not an life, degenerating neurologically to the vegetable stage is ridiculous because I haven't been here for a while, etc. IN MY OPINION. No one is obligated to share my thoughts. If believers can make sense of this, great.\n\nNothing legitimizes the incurable and unbearable suffering in my eyes. I don't want to wait for the excruciating suffering at the end before being injected with morphine and then letting myself die of hunger and thirst to finally return my skeletal body to my family.\n\nIdeally, I want to have planned the day a little in advance of the fateful period, experience everything that I can still experience with my beautiful loved ones, then plan a festive day of goodbye, eat well, laugh, say my goodbyes, a big hug to everyone in an atmosphere that has become more solemn, I tell them to celebrate my life not my death, and then I go to a room with the doctors and with the relatives who want to be present, I say a last goodbye and I'm leaving.\n\nIt's sad but I don't see the point in letting myself waste away or leaving my family with one last image of me in suffering and deep sadness. No! I was happy to know you, happy to have shared this incensed and absurd moment of existence with you, thank you for everything, I love you, END SCENE. Instead of desperately denying the inevitable. I am going to die, at least let me have an opinion on the circumstances, let me leave with dignity and consciously surrounded by my loved ones.",

I counted two reasonable ones.\n\nI am appalled that we have reached this level of verbal violence and gratuitous and agreed-upon frontal opposition, although probably no one has read the article due to the paywall.\n\nStill going through the ad-ecclesiam attacks recycled for 60 years (pedophile megnemegne) by the same people who undoubtedly still tolerate uncle-toutouche at the Christmas table and who forget that in the meantime the Church of France has submitted itself to an examination external to which no other Institution has submitted before it (and none after for the moment). There is certainly still a little work to achieve the exemplary quality to which it should be but still...\n  \nBut that we, as a society and in particular as a CSP+ micro-society like Reddit, are so incapable of confronting ideas to try to come up with a synthesis, and that we react to this level of epidermis and bleating sheep, it sincerely saddens me.\n \nIt is normal that we ask all experts in philosophical doctrines and social models their opinion on a question which goes well beyond the simple selfish act. We ask for the opinion of the president of the CEF, we ask for the opinion of philosophers, we ask for the opinion of caregiver associations, we ask for the opinion of patients, we even ask for the opinion of ordinary citizens drawn from the comes out even though Daniel Martin has absolutely never thought about the question. This is all normal and healthy.\n\nYou don't have to agree with this particular opinion (even if in this case you only read the headline and everyone knows that newspaper headlines are always chosen to reflect faithful to the content of the article and more in the opinion of the interviewee/s). But to refuse that someone, a fortiori someone who has the double legitimacy of having thought about the subject and of representing an institution which serves as a benchmark for a few million of our fellow citizens (not counting the fact that he probably accompanied more people at the end of their lives than anyone in the sub), expresses his opinion and that of the institution he represents, it is the beginning of a totalitarian thought which obviously does not shock many people here.\n \nI hope that one day we will all be able to take the time to get out of our busy circles to compare our ideas with those of others because there we are going to hit the wall by honking our horns.\n\nCitizenly yours",

Muslims like Jews are equally against any support for dying.\nDo they have a say? No more than another school of thought. But basically they lost and only represent themselves. Probably this is the position of the religious hierarchy, the basic priest sees every day a reality made of disarray and solitude. His look is certainly different.",

Especially in Belgium, the person's consent is required, and it is often the family who will offer this to the suffering person.\nI am pro-euthanasia, but clearly in all cases psychological help is needed for the family because it remains a tough decision, a conversation that you will carry with you for the rest of your life.

The time for debates is therefore limited and if the text cannot be examined in its entirety, it is theoretically necessary to resume during the next niche of this group.\n\nhttps://www.lemonde.fr/blog/cuisines-assemblee/2020/10/09/la-gestion-du-temps-lors-des-niches/\n\nIn practice, the government can decide to take up the bill by tabling a bill (thus a government initiative) identical to the agenda for the weeks reserved for it. On the other hand, this implies in the best case that the parliamentary shuttle starts from the beginning (including passage in committee) and the agenda is already busy until the end of the year.",

It was very well run, and the grandmother who was in charge reimbursed people with her money when there were losses. I also went to events (big anime conventions) and it went very well.\n\nA friend became president of a big board game association and had to put everything back together because it was a disaster. So I think the problem is that if people are not honest, they get away with a lot of things. In the association where I am we have just learned that 2 years ago they had embezzled 20,000 euros of public funds... but since it is my friend who is treasurer I told him that he had not interest in signing for something like this. The contracts are not up to standard either and they steal bottles from the town hall cellar...

It's like in the office with staff representatives who negotiate with HR without consulting the peons, and in the end we end up with decisions that are not always to our advantage.",

A little discussion will follow so in order not to waste the time of those who are not interested, I will immediately point out that I am wondering about the opening of my micro-enterprise in the IT field following my future conventional break.\n\nI also specify that if I post in the free forum, it is because:\n\n* I don't dare create a thread on r/france just for my questions which probably don't interest many people\n* r/vosfinances is quite active but I don't know if my question is really related to the sub (and frankly we are not in the context of r/conseillegal, too bad we should have an r/administrationFR)\n* r/entrepreneurfrance is a little dead\n\nBut if no one can answer me here I will have a thread on these three subreddits. And if you have any ideas where I could get this information on reddit or elsewhere, I'm interested! I'm going to make an appointment with pole emploi but the portrait my friends gave me doesn't really make me want to trust them... I'm also going to do a presentation session with an accountant but given that micro-enterprises are generally out of touch with their problems, I'm not sure they can help me.\n\nHere is a summary of my situation:\n\nFor several years, I have dreamed of stopping my professional activity. I have been an IT consultant for almost 10 years and over the course of this career, my skills have oriented me more and more towards functionality to the detriment of technology. As a result, I ended up doing mainly PMO strategy with a small part of technique on various PPM solutions. I master all these subjects well, my clients and my company are satisfied with my work, I have good benefits and a good situation... But hey, personally my passion is IT development, and I don't do any almost no longer today in the context of my professional activity. And frankly, project management isn't my thing and I've pretty much only been doing that for 3 years.\n\nIn short, this career does not make me happy and I would like to resign to take between one and two years of break to study and improve my skills in areas that are close to my heart and restart a career in development, if possible in the field of research and if possible with independent status. I put money aside to start this project, and a few weeks ago I announced to my manager and my HR that I was planning to resign.\n\nBeing on very good terms with my company and my customers, they were not really happy to hear the news but they understand my project and to give me a boost offered me a conventional termination under the following conditions:\n\n* I'm staying three months longer than planned to pass the torch\n* I accept an agreement binding us for 20 days of work at a preferential rate to amortize a little the cost of severance pay\n\nI will not hide from you that between the compensation that my company must pay me and the allowances that the state must pay me, this solution suits me enormously. It's one thing to put money aside, another to have the prospect of doubling the amount: that would be a valuable help in setting up my business.\n\nI inquired and learned that it was possible for me:\n\n1. to wait for the end of my permanent contract\n2. to declare myself as a job seeker at pole emploi\n3. to create a micro-enterprise\n4. to request [ACRE](https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/F11677)\n5. to request [ARCE](https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/F15252) (use these acronyms........)\n\nWhich would allow me to honor my agreement with my company, set up my microphone and already be ready to invoice for future clients, and receive 45% of my unemployment benefits in two installments over six months to start my project.\n\nProblem: I'm not completely inept when it comes to administrative matters, but this is too much. I don't know where to start, I'm afraid of doing something stupid, of having misunderstood something, of not being able to put together these files and therefore of crashing my project.\n\nI would like to point out that my goal is absolutely not to optimize my taxes or anything else. I would like to be able to take advantage of my RC, at least part of my unemployment benefits and to be able to bill my clients as needed next year. No more no less. So here are my questions:\n\n* Is my project (administratively speaking) feasible? Have I correctly understood these stories of conventional rupture, micro-enterprise, acre, arce or are there subtleties which escape me and would render my project obsolete?\n* I trust my manager and my HR. On the other hand, I don't know the rest of the hierarchy well.",

She told me that when her neighbor across the street moved she regularly saw cockroaches coming out of the apartment and into her house. The apartment opposite today was completely redone so normally no more cockroaches, they all migrated to my friend's house.\n\nAnd last night when I got up at night I actually saw 4/5 rather large cockroaches. I plan to do a big cleaning even in remote corners. I also wanted to buy cockroach traps but I went to 3 stores and the aisle is always completely empty and it's always the \"cockroach trap\" part. In addition to that, I see a lot of posts or even ads in the mailbox for pest control.\n\nAre cockroaches a seasonal thing?

        "Testo del post": "Today I would like to talk to you about a problem in our French countryside (and in our cities, but to a lesser extent). This afternoon, we had our cat euthanized. A cat who lived 5 years. It probably doesn't seem like much to you, but for the illness she suffered from, it's a record: She had leukosis (on average 2 years of life expectancy in cats who have had it forever). Since her birth, she has been contaminated by an oncogenic virus, which weakens her immune system and triggers cancers (lymphomas, leukemia). Everything is linked to a single problem: in our countryside many do not sterilize their cats and do not vaccinate them either (even though a vaccine exists and is super effective, but when we collect a kitten which then turns out to be already sick , as in our case, well it's too late).\n\nBelow are the most beautiful excuses from unconscientious masters:\n\nFirst the famous ‚ÄúI have no money‚Äù: lots of town halls and associations offer sterilization. Certainly not enough yet but if you don't have the money for this simple basic gesture and the vaccines well don't take animals, you have to be responsible.\n\nSecondly, the equally famous \"it's nature and then the cat is not happy if she doesn't have babies\" and other nonsense like this: I would like these people to stop thinking of themselves as veto apprentices: cats strays threaten the balance of biodiversity in our countryside (they prey on small mammals and birds to such an extent that they are now not far from being considered \"harmful\"). Moreover, a cat without babies is no worse off, two clicks on the internet and we see that it is a myth (without forgetting that many of these people stumble upon the litter in question... great trauma for the mother cat...).\n\nIn short, if you know people like that, send them the message: they destroy lives, they destroy families, they are monsters. Just for my cat's siblings, 5 families have lost their companion. Because of one stupid and not very smart guy. And unfortunately he's not alone...\n\nPS: the 3 in the back who laughed when they read the word ‚Äúpussy‚Äù we see you :p",

And there are several vaccines, some to be renewed every year.\n\nThis money is added to that which the owners will already spend for situations where the animal will be suffering: various infections, conjunctivitis, antipatasitis treatments, etc.\n\nSo when some people call for the issuance of a permit or compulsory checks to have a cat, in practice this amounts to prohibiting the most modest households from owning a cat.

There is additional aid for non-taxable people, even associations dedicated to homeless animals, associations which pay for exceptional care. But you have to pay for the kibble, litter, etc. You must always ensure that your animal is comfortable, keeping it if you cannot provide the bare minimum (with or without help) is not being responsible and being kind is being selfish. Besides, in your argument it is the happiness of the most modest that you are thinking of, not that of animals. If you love animals and don't have the money for them, go volunteer. The argument of the most modest ones goes down badly with me. When I lived with my mother we were below the poverty line (8000 euros PER YEAR together), well we treated our 2 previous cats like members of our family, we made sacrifices, we had put aside little ones nothing at all (a few euros) per month whenever we could. They had the best food and the best care. Question of priority, common sense and above all humanity. So I insist if in advance we see that we will not have the capacity to invest in an animal (it requires a lot of management when we are poor but it is doable) we do not take one.\n\nEdit: concrete example of sacrifice to treat a cat as a full member of your family: During internship at the hospital I see people who cancel their vacations to take care of a loved one with cancer. We didn't go on vacation to pay for vet care. You see if you treat your animal like a member of your family it comes naturally to you.",

        "Testo del post": "Hello, I don't know if I'm posting in the right place, but we learned three weeks ago that my mother's dog (labrador, 14 years old, epileptic and heart problems) also had a brain tumor. For three weeks, he has been under very expensive treatment, which apparently does not work since he continues to have seizures.\nThis morning is the third since the diagnosis. He shits and pees on himself during these attacks, his throat is bleeding because his treatment causes inflammation in his throat, he no longer gets up alone, has difficulty moving (he is no longer able to get on the sofa for example) and have difficulty feeding themselves.\nWhen 3 weeks ago we thought the veterinarian would recommend euthanasia, he preferred to offer an expensive treatment, reassuring my mother by telling her that the dog is not suffering. Mmmh.\nThis morning, my mother had to call my brother-in-law who lives 30 minutes away by car to help her transport the dog in the trunk, since my mother is unable to carry him (40kg per doggo).\nWe made my mother understand that this time, we will probably have to have him injected.\nArriving at the vet, the latter saw my mother in tears, he said to himself, here is a good pigeon and without batting an eyelid, and in front of my brother-in-law, he said that the dog was not suffering, that he still did not recommend the euthanasia and that instead we will try a new, ever more expensive treatment and that we will review the situation in 72 hours.\nFor us it's just trying to make money, postponing the inevitable.\nFYI, we're all going on vacation together tomorrow (well, my mother doesn't want to go with us anymore, that's understandable but hey) so if the same thing happens again as today, no one will be there to help to carry the dog in the car and it stresses us out.\n\nDo you know what we can do? Go see another vet, my mother doesn't want to (well yes, you think, her veto is going in her direction, since she doesn't want to say goodbye to her dog).\n\nFor the record, our childhood dog died in terrible circumstances from the same situation. (died by hitting her head on the ground, trying to get up when she could no longer do so). We always resented my mother a little, without telling her, because if our dog had been euthanized at the vet she would have left more peacefully.\n\nSorry for this long message but I'm a little angry here.\n\nEdit: after returning to the veterinarian at the end of the day with a view to euthanizing him, this time another veterinarian, the latter gave him an expensive treatment (what is their problem??) and told him that the Euthanasia was not possible because according to him the dog was doing well. So same opinion as the 1st.\nSo good that this morning, my mother went back there because of new attacks. Well the dog didn't make it, he died in the car.\nFrankly, what's the point of ruining the Google reviews of these two vetoes? I'm itching. My mother finds herself with two treatments on her arms that are of no use to her and the urn of her deceased dog not as it should have been.",

Nana once told me ‚ÄúI have to come and say goodbye to him‚Ä¶‚Äù It‚Äôs been 2 years and he‚Äôs doing well, thank you)\n\nThat would be the good side of a clinic; multiply the opinions to see if a majority recommend the treatment, or not. Such an important decision should be informed.\n\nIf ever; how much is the treatment? For our part it's also quite high, but I know how much the treatment at the highest dosage costs for a 50kg grandfather, yours shouldn't be higher.",

Nuclear power is a good solution in terms of electricity, but Co2 is not just an electrical problem.\n\n2) No, in a secular state religion is not prohibited in the public sphere, it is not prohibited to publicly show one's belonging to a faith or cult. And so no, I cannot accept this proposal. And I say this as someone who considers himself anticlerical. But for me this does not justify state atheism. Freedom of conscience includes religious freedom even if I disagree with the religious idea. And I do not see what right would deprive a citizen of this freedom of expression in the standard framework of civic life (as opposed to the specific case such as a civil servant in his functions).\n\n3) No for the increase, quite simply because given our level of taxation I have difficulty seeing how it actually increases. We have an average rate on each euro of income of 56%. Afterwards on the maintenances, yes, we are not going to massively cut the overall budget, even the tax/expenditure cuts are in fact minimal compared to the total budget.\n\n4) the inequalities of what? If it's disposable income not really, the d2 after taxes is 30k per Uc, the d9 is 50k. In this gap, you have 80% of the population. So no, in terms of income, inequalities are not really a problem. If it's wealth inequalities, I would also say no because what I want is the reduction of wealth poverty and not wealth inequality, but unfortunately given that France has chosen just-in-time for its pensions , we increase wealth poverty (and wealth inequalities)\n\nhttps://blog.insee.fr/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/fig2-decomposition-de-la-redistribution-du-revenu-national-en-2016.png\n\n5) Perhaps, reducing income inequalities involves increasing primary income, through education, the establishment of infrastructure, and a legal system. And through taxes and transfers. It's a dual system.\n\n6) no, discrimination on religious grounds must be prohibited. Afterwards, yes, it is possible not to like Islam but not to have a problem with a Muslim.\n\n7) yes, there are problems. The goal of a state with immigration is to import people who are richer and more productive than the average. The best is when they are fiscally positive (more than 35k per Uc). Below that, from a tax perspective, it's a loss. (to be nuanced because you have some name given when you are an immigrant but it is to give an idea. Afterwards on the social aspect, it is not that he is Muslim the problem. If we imported American evangelists, or extreme Hindus, that would pose the same problem to me. It's just that we import people who are religious into a secular system, which adds its share of problems.\n\n8) clearly, thesis salaries even in level stuff are shit. And salaries are generally low in France in tech, to have friends in engineering doctorates, except to work in ultra-specific labs, you don't stay in France. Why bother when you can get paid more in the USA or Canada for example. So in France we like to say ‚Äúyes but we have social security‚Äù. Except that when you earn 150k in junior without stock compensation and with company mutual insurance, you don't care a bit about social security.\n\n9) yes for all three.\n\n10) anti-racism is above all a huge mess, I don't know if it's due to social networks, but it's an incomprehensible mass. Where it is complicated to know what is a clich√© or something that is accepted as consensus by this community.\n\n11) generally yes, but the car would be less of a problem with a real carbon tax.\n\n12) same as the car.\n\n13) stupidity I don't know for the passive anti-values, but for the active ones who are activists, yes",

It flies away from him, perhaps when he needs it the most. A man's reputation may be sacrificed in a moment of ill-considered action. The people who are prone to fall on their knees to do us honor when success is with us may be the first to throw the stone of malice when failure settles its cloud upon our heads. The one absolutely unselfish friend that a man can have in this selfish world, the one that never deserts him and the one that never proves ungrateful or treacherous is his dog.\n\n> Gentlemen of the jury: A man's dog stands by him in prosperity and in poverty, in health and in sickness. He will sleep on the cold ground, where the wintry winds blow and the snow drives fiercely, if only he may be near his master's side. He will kiss the hand that has no food to offer, he will lick the wounds and sores that come in encounters with the roughness of the world. He guards the sleep of his pauper master as if he were a prince. When all other friends desert, he remains. When riches take wings and reputation falls to pieces, he is as constant in his love as the sun in his journey through the heavens.\n\n> If fortune drives the master forthwith an outcast in the world, friendless and homeless, the faithful dog asks no higher privilege than that of accompanying him to guard against danger, to fight against his enemies, and when the last scene of all comes, and death takes the master in his embrace and his body is laid away in the cold ground, no matter if all other friends pursue their way, there by his graveside will the noble dog be found, his head between his paws, his eyes sad but open in alert watchfulness, faithful and true even to death.\n\n\n/\n\n> ‚ÄúIf there are no dogs in Heaven, then when I die I want to go where they went.‚Äù",

I think it traumatized me lol\n\nThe second was a dog that had been taken in, she seemed to have been abandoned or lost. Its particularity was to have a different color in each eye, including a blue one, hence its name (Azure). But we had to give her to someone because she was constantly eating the neighbor's chickens, and he was threatening to shoot her with his rifle.\n\nThe third was the one we had the longest, but he died of an illness that we couldn't cure. Well, he was a little old, but not that much and he could live for a few more years. The good side (?) is that the vet said he wasn't in pain.\nWe buried it at the bottom of the garden next to the first one, and I still sometimes go there when I come back to my parents, even though I'm not a believer at all.",

(unfortunately)\n\nMy girlfriend and I adopted 2 female rats, now a little over 2 years old each, Choupette and Poupette.\n\nThey are at the end of their lives, they are potentially suffering because they are sick (blood in the urine), porphyne flowing from their eyes, blood coming out of their nostrils swelling; The symptoms are not at their peak I think but it is alarming. So we went to the vet... 68‚Ç¨ to tell us it's a cold while giving me medicine for... I've never peed blood for a cold personally.\n\nSo if it doesn't get better with medication, if it gets worse in the next few days, I will euthanize her if she suffers too much. Except that the vet is dead (cause: The vet does not want to euthanize them). So here is :\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo you know of a way to put my rats to sleep, so that I can then deal them the fatal blow?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS: This is not a debate on euthanasia, I have my own opinion just like you; I'm just asking for answers to my question, thank you for your understanding.",

There's no point in telling young people to vote with the idea that a solution will come from this political system. Our political system is undemocratic, allows the renewal in power of the same social class (the rich, and when I say the rich, I'm talking about the real ones, the 1% and all that).\n\n To finish my comment, imagine that young people all went to vote, for a candidate regardless of his politics, this candidate to the general surprise(s) does not respect his program (if it still happens). What do young people do, they are not happy, they were scammed, but voting me is the solution (see the postulate above), they will vote for another guy who has an interesting program, this guy is elected, and we is all proud of the impact of young people in political life, the abstention rate is much lower than over the last 20 years. And the president, to everyone's surprise (copypaste all that), does not respect his program. And we good citizens that we are are of no use, because we have no direct or indirect political power.\n\nVoting is absolutely not a solution, we need a fundamental debate (this is already the hardest step) to know what political system the French want (knowing that they are sovereign in a democracy) , and see how we can develop the system. There is no person with a chance of being elected who will create a democracy in France.\n\nWell, I'm inflamed, but the vote is so useless, even the pseudo political ideas \"right\" or \"left\" don't mean anything, Hollande was more to the right than Sarkozy. We tested this system, where the rich choose candidates for whom we vote, it allows us to maintain the illusion of democracy. Just listening to the number of times we use the word democracy to designate our political system, it's aberrant. And the fact, that we have people on TV who make fun of dictatorships because it's anti-right, anti-everything (which is potentially true in itself) but we live in a dictatorship too, it's just that it's not embodied by a person but by a social class that is a minority in number and a majority in money. So yes, great we have freedom of expression (it's a good thing, I think), but if we have no political power, what is the use of this freedom of expression apart from occupying ourselves with the phantasmagorical delusions of political figures.\n\nIn the meantime, we have no impact on the politics of our country, and voting is probably not the solution. How to change the constitution, a referendum?",

This should be a strong signal for those in power to implement changes so that people believe in politics again. At least we have the chance, unlike some countries, to have the right and not the obligation to vote.\nFor me, making voting compulsory is proof that the democratic system in place has failed.\n\nPersonally, unlike /u/BowieUndone above, if I'm not going to vote, it's not out of laziness, but because I stopped believing in politics a long time ago. Whether you vote right or left, it's exactly the same thing. It's all a big charade designed to give people the illusion that they have a choice and can choose to change things. If you inform yourself other than with the propaganda of the express/liberation and all that crap, you understand that power has long been bought by the 1% who own the banks/insurance companies/MSM and company.\n\nAs Coluche said: ‚Äúif voting could change things, it would have been banned a long time ago.‚Äù Whether it's the left, the right, or even the extreme right, all these people eat at the same canteen. Even Marine, who presents herself as the candidate for change, I am not convinced that she has a real program that will change things for the 99%.\n\nOn the other hand, I will be the first to queue at the polling station if a guy (or a woman in this case) has the cojones to hold a referendum on leaving the EU.\n\nIt's been 15 years since I last voted. And when I see the candidates we've been banging all this time, I see that at least I didn't waste my time with these antics. For 2017, I probably won't vote either. I will spend my time on tasks that have more potential to change my future: my personal job, reading a book to learn how to better invest my money, reading a book on how to better educate my child, etc.",

First of all, I don't think that Brexit or Trump are short-term choices (it's more a return to sovereignism, even if manipulated); but above all, short-term choices imply immediate interest, therefore in particular personal interest, while in contrast a long-term choice would be more for the general interest at the expense of particular interest.\n\nIt seems to me that if those over 50 vote for Fillon and his retirement at 65, for example, it is precisely for a long-term overall vision, rather than for short-term personal interest (me first). It would piss me off to work longer, but it seems necessary to me). As I said in another comment, seniors also have the best interests of their children and grandchildren at heart.\n\n> I also explain my opinion on the difference in orientation of the young vote and the senior vote, in particular because of our culture which is very different.\n\nFor me, what explains the difference in voting between young people and old people is that young people are in rebellion, revolution, we want to break everything and rebuild the world, we are all brothers and sisters, love and flowers ; and then when we get older, we calm down, we fall into line, we realize that we cannot change the system and that improving it a little would already be good. It's a natural process, we become conservative because \"it was better before\"; we want to be able to preserve and pass on the little we have acquired; when we are old we don't like change, we are more afraid; but also when we are old we have learned more, we know better that revolutions rarely go well, and we become more cautious.",

                        "Testo della risposta": "So, to be schematic. Because otherwise, it goes in all directions. And my goal is not to write an academic article on this post.\n\nAlready, basically, terfs is an overused term, which was initially used to characterize radical anti-trans feminists. For them, gender, as well as heterosexuality, is a social construct that must be destroyed, because it is what leads to male domination. Additionally, for some terfs, gender is also a social construct. And one of their ways was to live in a female community. As a result, trans women, by changing gender, are seen as colonizers who seek to destroy the female class in order to ensure the survival of patriarchy. And trans men as well as heterosexual trans people are class traitors, because they prevent the destruction of patriarchy and heterosexuality.\n\nNow, the term terfs refers to all women who claim to be feminists, even if they have no ounce of radicalism, like moutout or stern. Stern, moutot, or rowling, it's rather gender and sex are social realities and trans people cannot change sex/gender.\n\nBut overall, for terfs, gender change remains a danger for the female class.\n\nOn the side of trans people, there are several approaches. There is the innate side, where the gender identity which is innate is different from the sex at birth. There is the queer transfeminism side, close to queer feminism, which considers that sex and gender are social constructions, but that to put an end to patriarchy, it is better to favor the multiplicity of genders/sexes. And there is the transmaterialist side (for France at least) of considering trans people as class defectors, and which analyzes everything against the backdrop of class struggle (men vs. women, trans vs. cis) and on the materiality of body. But actually, the central point is that gender is not always correlated with sex.\n\nBasically, roughly, you have more or less identified the terf and trans ideologies. On the other hand, the divergence is not linked to gender. The divergence lies in whether or not it is possible to change gender/sexual class. Yes for trans people, no for terfs.\n\nSo. Ps, I'm trans, which should therefore give an indication of which side of the debate I'm on.",

        "Testo del post": "Hello sub,\n\nHere I think that like many Francis, there are many people here who are against euthanasia, having a very radical position without really knowing the subject and who adopt this posture more in agreement with your moral values ‚Äã‚Äãand fantasies around the subject . As I was one of these people and given current events, I wanted to share with you my experience which led me to change my mind on the subject.\n\nSo for the story, I have two of my grandparents who died of incurable and very painful illnesses (respectively a G-P of 71 years, skin cancer which turned into generalized cancer and a G-M of 98 years , leukemia + kidney failure) so unfortunately I have very specific experience of what the end of life is, how it happens in hospitals from a patient/family point of view.\n\nEdit: maybe not precise, and note that I am not in the medical profession but let's say that I have had the same experience twice, twice too many I want to say.\n\nReceived idea: Euthanasia does not exist in France.\n\nSo I'll explain to you right away, in practice it's false. Today we support people in services called ‚Äúpalliative care‚Äù and we ‚Äúhelp‚Äù them to die.\n\nHow do we do it?\n\nWe sedate them and stop feeding them, people die of starvation or dehydration. In theory, normally, there is still an intravenous infusion of saline solution so that the body is not dehydrated and if the sedation is done well it may seem ok.\n\nBut in practice, the reality of hospitals (I will not go into the debate of faults on the part of caregivers or lack of resources/lack of staff) means that patients wake up (relatively often) due to lack of sedation and literally collapse and die. thirsty. I saw 2 of my grandparents die like this, including my 71-year-old grandfather. The saline drip just stuck to his skin, weakly begging me to give him food and drink when I visited him. And my grandmother had an intramuscular injection instead of an intravenous injection whose arm was swollen by the solution flowing into her muscle tissue (if you have ever seen a drowned person it was the same on his arm).\n\nSo for now it's relatively effective, in one week people die, it works very well however I won't tell you the ordeal for sick people, who in addition to suffering from their already painful illness, die of thirst and hunger For days. Nor the trauma for families when you see your loved ones transformed into zombies asking for water like beggars. And the ordeal of knowing they are suffering without really knowing when it will end.\n\nThere is therefore no dignity for the person themselves or their loved ones who forever keep the disturbing image of a dehumanizing and degrading end of life.\n\nI can already see some zealots telling me that all they had to do was jump off a bridge. To which I would answer them 2 things:\n\n\\- Firstly, if we had known what awaited our loved ones and the reality on the ground, we would probably have thrown them away ourselves, even if it meant going to pick up and scrape the pieces on the asphalt. It would have remained less traumatic for everyone.\n\n\\- Deuxio, your fantasy of incurable illness romanticized √† la Breaking Bad, where people in their fifties in apparent good health learn from a doctor that they only have 3 months to live then go out to continue to live their last moments with their family or go around the world to make their dreams come true before dying is only a fraction of the reality. You should go take a look at the geriatrics, I think you would have some surprises.\n\nFor my grandfather, for example, from the moment the diagnosis was established he was no longer able to move on his own. As for my grandmother, she had been very handicapped for years, she could no longer move or communicate except by gestures of the head and one hand. Medical helpers came daily to wash him (including wiping his buttocks). For your information, my grandmother wanted to see the sea again before she died, she could not fulfill this wish, because we did not have the means to pay for medical transport. So I'll let you give me an action plan to tell me how to commit suicide in the circumstances in case it happens to me, I'm impatiently awaiting your (brilliant) ideas...\n\nI will also spare you the detailed narration from patients in neighboring rooms that we hear in the corridors during visits. Moaning and begging for help, making you think you're traveling back to the dark ages of the Middle Ages.\n\nIn short, I would simply say that I hope you never experience that.

They go wrong, liquids and food pass into the lungs and they choke. From this moment on and if the person refuses the therapeutic relentlessness we can no longer feed them.\n\nInfusions (subcutaneous, intramuscular do not exist, NaCl is serum physiology we prefer glucose if there is a question of maintaining life) are for comfort, in order to avoid dehydration. The people we receive are so exhausted that they often leave quickly once their mind and body have calmed down (= a little shot of valium.....). They stop fighting. Legally it is not euthanasia, but it comes close. There is also deep and continuous sedation (hypnovel + morphine) for people who clearly express their wish. This is the only possibility of appeasement before death really authorized by law, but in practice it is rarely done. Free and informed consent at the end of life is rather rare...\n\nI'm lucky to work in a service that is solely dedicated to that (a nurse and a caregiver for no more than 3 patients. A classic service is 1 ide for ~ 15 patients, and nursing homes are even worse), but it's so rare in France!! It's the only one in the city where I work, there is another one 40 minutes away. Afterwards I don't know anyone else around. This is one of the end-of-life problems in France. I am sincerely sorry that your grandparents passed away in pain. Even leaving euthanasia aside, people turn a blind eye to the end of life. We ignore it, we leave it aside. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just old people, eh, that‚Äôs normal.‚Äù Many forget that they are also fathers, mothers, sons/daughters, friends.\n\nI want euthanasia to be legal once I need it. Because in addition to the death, it is often weeks or even months and months of suffering beforehand. Very little for me thank you.",

What I'm saying is that in practice I saw my grandfather's IV simply placed (not pricked and taped to the needle to hold) and for my grandmother obviously the vein had been missed ( I think) which meant that the perfusion was intramuscular (or subcutaneous which is perhaps a more appropriate term) instead of being intravenous. The arm had time to swell, but no one looked and she stayed like that for 2 days before we noticed it when we visited her.\n\nAfterwards I can understand that the working conditions are not ideal everywhere, from memory this was not the case in the hospital departments where my grandparents stayed, I no longer have the figures in mind but the number of nurses and caregivers seemed insignificant to me for the number of patients.\n\nFor now, I am not angry with the caregivers but with the system, although like everywhere there are people who are very careful and others who are very negligent in their work.\n\nAnd unfortunately I would have liked us to be better informed about end-of-life possibilities, even among doctors it's a taboo subject I have the impression. We were left to our own devices, family and patient. I think my grandfather would have liked to have been plunged into deep sedation, we were never given the information (afterwards it was 8 years ago now I don't know if it was customary at the time )",

When you think you are coming and returning to nothingness, you can on the contrary think that a few years of suffering do not weigh much, that even a small potential to experience happiness once again, however fleeting it may be, outweighs everything. .\n\nSo yes, it's the religious people who tend to want to govern the lives of others and limit their choices, but the idea that existence is infinitely precious because it only lasts a moment is rather something profoundly atheist.\n\nI'm talking about true atheism, the one that doesn't tell itself any stories, that doesn't even reassure itself with bullshit like \"it's the great cycle of life.\" For whom the prospect of eternal damnation remains consolatory, because ultimately hell would be good news: it is always better than nothing.",

But not entrusting this sort of thing to doctors also has its own problems.\n\n\\- Finally, there is the risk of drift. It is very important and supervision is difficult. Once euthanasia is legalized, the posts will no longer be about the unfortunate people who die in horrible suffering, but there will be just as many on \"They got rid of grandma by 'convincing' to be euthanized\" or \"Social security, for reasons of economy, announces that it encourages euthanasia rather than the treatment of such serious pathology\".\n\nNot to mention that creating a legal process giving authorization to others to end your life I don't dare imagine what a malicious state could do with it.\n\nI will end by quoting the film The Ballad of Narayama, from 1983, which shows that in ancient times, in societies where survival was difficult, it was customary (and social pressure imposed it) for people aged \" clear the floor\" in a way, even when they were not particularly bedridden, because often people do not want to bother or be a burden for their loved ones and for society.

Frankly, I was a little young so I didn't really realize it, but it was heavy. I don't know what she would have wanted (too young to have even had a conversation on the subject with her), and I don't know what my grandfather and his children would have wanted, but I say that this is a typical case where it could apply (provided you have established it in advance, well I leave that in the conditional obviously).",

I was lucky to experience excellent palliative care services where patients (and their families) were supported with gentleness and kindness and it is with sadness that I see that this was not your case.\nWe are clearly not ready for euthanasia in France, for the medical profession (the responsibility is great and so is the social pressure).\nWhen the covid crisis began, it coincided with the authorization for doctors to carry out terminal sedation (deep and continuous until death) in the homes of patients at the end of life. Well, there was an outcry in the media, saying that we were taking the opportunity to kill our old people quickly at home so that they don't clutter up the hospital! While the Leonetti law has authorized terminal sedation for much longer for end-of-life patients who request it.\nMost people faced with the end of life of their loved ones realize that they had a different idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe end of life, perhaps a little fantasized/imagined like that which we see in the films (people, silent and dignified in their beds, loving family next door, beautiful music on the soundtrack, etc.). In truth, death, just like life, is not very smooth, it is not very calm, and it is not necessarily very dignified. It sends us back to what is animal in us. We've just lost the habit, because instead of letting our elders and loved ones end their days at home, we send them to nursing homes or hospitals. I think that euthanasia should be an option for people who wish it, within a well-defined legal framework (fortunately we will not have to be pioneers in this matter, there are countries which are well ahead of us in terms of legislation and organization of medically assisted suicide). In the same way that I think that our palliative services should be expanded, and that we should talk earlier about patients' wishes regarding their end of life (and not wait until the moment when patients are no longer in condition). to express themselves, leaving decisions to the medical teams who must deal with family members who are often confused and in pain).",

This is done subcutaneously in a slow flow. If it creates a \"pocket\" of water under the skin it is because the flow was too fast (because they moved, because they were poorly adjusted initially...) but in any case it should not be painful and hydration should be achieved/absorbed.

And unfortunately, as in many healthcare services, if you are not in a specialized unit with a correct patient/caregiver ratio, you are terribly short of time to support people in the last days of their existence.\n\nUndercut hydration helps limit ‚Äúdeath of thirst‚Äù as you characterize it. Most people at the end of life are often in a daze of almost comatose sleep, reinforced by the use of midazolam + morphine therapy.\nSometimes the dosages are insufficient because they have to be re-adjusted regularly and it's horrible to learn that your GP has suffered from this.\n\nNow for the slightly less... Legal side. The Leonetti law says, I paraphrase, that it is authorized to administer therapies with the aim of providing comfort and plunging the patient into deep sedation *even if this has the side effect of shortening life*. In two of the three departments in which I worked there is a sort of tacit and unspoken agreement. Doctors prescribe very high doses ‚Äúif necessary‚Äù and allow IDEs to have a ‚Äúheavy hand‚Äù on the doses.\n\nIt is therefore not rare, if not common, for certain IDEs, an open secret, in agreement with doctors, to do what is called \"pushing patients\". Basically, large doses of Moprhine, administered with documentation confirming their usefulness, accelerate the process of death in patients.\n\nMy colleagues and I often do this when the patient seems to be in constant discomfort, the family has already started the grieving process \"we just want him/her to go now\".\n\nOf course, we don't talk about it openly, because it is forbidden to euthanize in France...

Palliative care does not let patients die of thirst and hunger, this is a misconception of people who do not understand human physiology.\n\nAn idea spread by doctors, it was my grandfather's oncologist who confirmed it when we asked him if it was really a death sentence, maybe he wanted to do the right thing, I don't know.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> And it is very paradoxical to criticize the teams for stopping hydration (which will not improve the patient's condition) to keep the patient artificially alive, which can easily be considered as relentlessness, and at the same time advocate the legalization of euthanasia... These are 2 opposing logics.\n\nin fact there is a perfectly coherent logic which is to say that we do not want to see loved ones who are already suffering too much asking us for food and drink and adding unnecessary suffering on top of the existing suffering.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> Euthanasia is homicide in France, and any sedation, any cessation of treatment (including phy infusion, and cessation of oral nutrition) are always justified in the file and normally discussed with the immediate family. This is medico-legal, and a doctor has no interest in risking disbarment and a criminal trial for this.\n\nI am not saying that the cessation of serum phy infusion was recorded in the medical file. I say that in practice the infusion was not done in my grandfather's case, the needle was simply placed on the skin and taped like that without any trace of an injection. So at a given moment for a person who does not have the strength to move, who does not receive his perf and who is not brought to drink. there is no entry of water into the body and on the other hand there is an obvious loss so you do not need to have done advanced math/specialized math to assess the water in the body. So is this bad care intended? I don't know, and I don't think so. In any case, I am not from the medical profession, I note that in fact the IVs were poorly done, that's all because the same goes for my grandmother who stayed two days with an IV where the vein was missed and who had the arm was completely swollen and it was us (the family) who noticed it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> (he opens his eyes = he is poorly sedated, his mouth is dry = he dies of dehydration...)\n\nWell actually from the moment the person starts begging for water, the sedation was done incorrectly, am I wrong?

I worked on a cohort of palliative care patients whose average length of stay was between 2 and 3 weeks. I suspect that not all services have the same DMS but I find it quite shocking to condone dehydration over such a long period...\n2) the same for nutrition. If I understood correctly (and I'll let you correct me if not) the overall message is \"well nothing is a good idea.

Lots of interesting and touching comments, too (thanks for the movie recommendation [u/Stelteck](https://www.reddit.com/u/Stelteck/) ).\n\nI have no real bias on the subject of euthanasia. But some food for thought:\n\n\\- I'm bothered by all the discussion around dignity; perhaps precisely because what dignity is should be the conclusion of a long discussion, and not one of its premises. If we consider that it is unworthy to be hurt (for example), a reasoning opposite to yours could lead to wanting to euthanize the incontinent.\n\\- The possibility opens the door to the will: the existence of euthanasia can encourage the desire to be euthanized. (I'm going to take the first analogy that comes to mind; as clumsy as it may be: the waves of suicides do not come only from a common cause, but from the act of a person who favors the one of his knowledge).\n\\- But must the will in the moment necessarily be listened to? For example, a 35-year-old depressed person who asks to be euthanized, should we respond to their request, or should we try to give them a taste for life again? (In practice we tend to wash our hands of it, of course)\n\nWe can of course take into account the person's age, health, etc. and here we come closer to the example you give.\n\nStill, if the current situation still makes it possible to end life unofficially, or even illegally, that's already it. Well, it's true that it's not super exciting to go to prison because you helped a loved one die.\n\nIt seems to me that dignity is a concept essentially linked to the legal fictions that found societies. And our society recognizes both self-determination as a fundamental concept and the possibility of not being in full possession of one's means (without really knowing what that means): this creates a fairly vague field within which we can justify almost all arguments (if we divide them into 4 categories: pro-euthanasia with and without consent / anti-euthanasia with and without consent).\n\nPersonally, almost all legal frameworks suit me (among other things because we are always free to violate them); what concerns me more are social preconceptions (and legal frameworks help to define them; and we are less likely to violate them because they act directly on our ways of thinking).\nTo what extent is the suffering we have at seeing loved ones leave inherent to our ‚Äúhuman nature‚Äù, and to what extent is it ‚Äúconstructed‚Äù?\nAnd to what extent should we flee this suffering rather than accept it?\nTo what extent is the dying person affected by the two previous questions?\netc.\n\nAny position on the subject is necessarily a moral position.",

When we know that in certain cases in these services, there is a medical decision to no longer feed and to put people who can no longer eat on an infusion of phy serum only (saline solution). We already know that these people will die in the coming weeks or months, either from lack of food or from worsening of the disease.\n\nSo in fact all the abuses/borderline cases that you describe are already taken into account and I don't think there is any question of changing the rules in these cases. People do not enter palliative care because they have misunderstood or because they want to die. In any case, a 35 year old in good health who wants to die dies without any problem, he doesn't need anyone.\n\nIn short, what I suggest is instead of sending people to palliative care (where we KNOW that they are going to die in the medium-long term anyway). Let's help them die quickly and without pain or trauma for the families.",

A priori, I am someone attached to the free disposal of my body, I do not feel concerned by the religious taboo which reigns around death. So, rather for, at first glance.\n  \nBut here it is: it turns out that I am suicidal, I have been depressed for 2 years now. It is not the first time. My life is, at the moment, a great suffering: I no longer have a taste for anything, I have difficulty maintaining a social circle around me, I am physically in pain at all hours of the day. I am not independent, I am sick. I don't know if this disease can be cured: maybe yes, but maybe not. However, if I wish to die with dignity, and not by throwing myself into the Loire, or from the 4th floor of my residence, I am almost sure that it will not be granted to me in the context of euthanasia. . And that's the problem: where do I draw the line between who is acceptable to kill and who should be kept alive? We cannot rely on criteria of individual consent (see my own example). So should there be objective criteria? Would this then mean that only certain illnesses or conditions will be eligible for the choice of death? This opens up immense moral dilemmas: why this one rather than another? What message do we send to people with an eligible disorder: the one that society thinks you're better off dead than alive? Conversely, what message for those who are not eligible: your suffering is not so terrible? What about the risk of subsequent abuse (I'm thinking of the woman who murdered her 3-year-old son because he was disabled, and who later wrote a book about it)?\n  \nThe debate is really very complicated for me to decide, because the limits we place on our own life are constantly changing: we can decide that it's over for us the moment we can no longer walk alone, then when that day arrives, we postpone until the moment we can no longer speak. Ultimately, the cases where it is \"obvious\" are not that numerous, and the errors of assessment by doctors/relatives would be irreparable.\n  \n*The subject is very sensitive, I hope I haven't offended anyone, if this is the case, don't hesitate to let me know here or in PM*",

Well-conducted palliative care allows patients' pain and anxiety to be properly treated without the need to euthanize people (except in extreme cases).\n\nEuthanasia in concrete terms is: we bring a syringe of a deadly product that we inject and we watch the patient go into cardiac arrest. Most, the vast majority of caregivers, would exercise their conscience clause if such a law were passed, and even if services exercised it, nothing would guarantee that the quality of care would be improved.\n\nYes ! Generally speaking, as in most hospitals in France today, the quality of care is declining. Yes ! there are not enough staff, yes not enough resources, yes not the appropriate tools for good patient care. But I believe that we have finished applauding caregivers and that we have returned to the pre-crisis doctrine: I want exemplary medical care without spending a penny. It doesn't work and I repeat, the quality of care is steadily declining.\n\nAfterwards, as mentioned elsewhere, to have quality care, nothing beats Switzerland where paying a lot of money guarantees you access to quality medical care.

For me it's active euthanasia in disguise. As I say, patients who can no longer eat or eat if there is a decision to eliminate the supply of glucose or water, this amounts to condemning them. To draw a parallel, deliberately cutting off the oxygen of a person on life support amounts to killing them, even if that person is condemned to die. why would this be an active act for oxygen, and passive for water or glucose? the 3 are essential elements for the proper functioning of the human body, right?\n\nSo yes euthanasia does exist in France but it is only passive euthanasia.",

Given the success of this post I think that yes, freedom is not a current value. Let's see alcohol and cigarettes are expensive for society: a government or a party or a pressure group could well prohibit them? If we do not have certain skills and certain financial means can we have children could we not institute a permit? People spend their money poorly and do not invest it Couldn't we properly force them to buy certain products and invest their money in certain funds?\n\nI'm serious, I think that for 90% of people, freedom is just a word, a luxury that we can do without.\"\n\n68 comments to ban\n14 to defend freedom",

Is it possible to use home insurance?\n\nI thought I saw that a TV panel cost 70-80% of the TV.
