It needs to have an open debate, and the safeguards need to be discussed and implemented correctly, instead of the state of affairs at the moment, where it's just a null issue.\n\nIt's just as ridiculous for people who don't want to die in pain, and without control, to have to fly, ***on their own*** due to the current law, to another country to die there, away from family and friends.  \n\nHowever there are issues, such as people being pushed towards euthanasia \"services\", especially if it's a privately-run thing. I highly doubt the government would be keen to finance the whole thing, and if it were a privately run operation there would be cost involved for the patient and where there's profit to be made, there is the possibility that greed and abuse of it might follow. So that's a discussion point there. \n\nit's not JUST a moral question. Morally, I think it's perfectly justified, it's more the manner in which the policy is implemented that raise concerns, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't have the debate.",

All death, for whatever reason except when it was Time, was bad and if you caused some of it, you were culpable.\n\nWhatever about that, law seeks to govern property. When someone is charged with murder or manslaughter, isn't it becasue that individual has unlawfully taken the future of the victim, thieved the life and time that 'belonged' to them and their family, that is primarily where their grievance lies. It is easy to see why the law exists to punish those that 'steal' life but suicide and euthanasia are so fundamentally different to murder and manslaughter. \n\nIf I was to be anti-euthanasia-permitting laws, it would have to be for the same reason as I might have to have if I was pro-life in the abortion debate - that all life is so absolutely sacred, that it, in all it's forms must be protected and prolonged for as long as physically possible. But I don't think like that so I agree with you. Legislation should be invoked when someone unlawfully steals a life, but where there is no unlawful theft or behavior, the state should just keep the nose out.",

I could blink, turn my head a little, move one arm a very small amount, and make a non-specific 'gahhhh' sound. That was it, physically. Mentally, I was totally capable.\n\nThe condition is rare, and it's very rare to happen in someone who is otherwise quite healthy. My Consultant was pretty pessimistic that I would make a recovery at all. I truly, honestly believed that for the remainder of my life, I would watch my condition bankrupt my parents as they tried to accommodate a severely disabled son, ruin the life of my then-fiancee, and live in extreme discomfort in a world which I could not interact with at all.\n\nI wanted to die; I don't think it was an overreaction, I don't think, based on the evidence that was in front of me, that it was a spur-of-the-moment decision. I saw twenty or so years of life ahead of me that would have offered me nothing but misery.\n\nThis is just a personal view, and it's worth saying that clearly I made a great recovery. But I know that if I was in that position again with a *guarantee* that it was permanent, I would feel the same. It's not enough to simply be alive; quality of life is crucial. Modern medical science can keep people who alive who are incredibly sick, but it cannot cure them. These people should be able to make a decision about their own fates.\n\nOf course, any law that was actually written would need safeguards, but that is true of any law at all. But the cowardice of politicians, to dodge this issue, infuriates me hugely. We have a mismatch between medical science and our laws, and people like Tony Nicklinson and Debbie Purdy call them to our attention. They are mentally capable people who made a reasonable decision that living in this world was too painful for them. As long as we cannot cure these people of their condition, we should be able to relieve them of their pain.",

Although it does happen in the UK often under the guise of passive euthanasia (most famous example being George V who was given a mixture pain killers (morphine and cocaine) to end his suffering)\n\nPersonally I do not see any issue with legalising active voluntary euthanasia. Non-voluntary euthanasia should also be legalised under medical review board. Involuntary euthanasia is another matter (the difference between involuntary and non-voluntary euthanasia is that in non-voluntary, consent can not be given, for example the person is in a coma whereas involuntary euthanasia is euthanasia occurring against the will of the patient.). Whether someone acting as power of attorney over a patient  can express their will changing what would be a non-voluntary case in to a voluntary or involuntary case is were the debate should be. If someone with the power of attorney has the ability to over-rule medical opinion in a case it may also be necessary to legalise involuntary euthanasia for use in some extreme cases.",

Individuals would need to make the decision themselves before entering the hospital stating they consent to doctors using euthanasia as a last resort, rather than open the floodgates and allow family to decide other than in special circumstances - the Court could play a part in this as they currently do with turning off life support for legally \"brain dead\" patients.\n\nBefore entering hospital for any treatment, patients should be given the option to allow it if, heaven forbid, the treatment goes wrong and leaves them physically and/or mentally damaged that any ordinary and comfortable life would not be possible. I haven't been to hospital for ages but presumably consent forms exist, to limit liability and to show you accept any treatment, like with any contract?\n\nI can't see it being possible that the law would change and people who definitely cannot communicate that they want to die being allowed to do so. Expressing consent is important and just because the opinion of family may want it doesn't mean it's right. The Court should probably get involved in this area to play Devil's advocate, along with medical opinion, to determine if someone who cannot communicate their intentions should be allowed to have their suffering come to an end.\n\nSo many elderly friends and even family have died asking for death every time they wake up. It's painful to see, yet when I've seen family pets be put to sleep it's such a surreal yet dignified moment that it makes you wonder why people can't have it.",

She's had a minor stroke 5 years ago and it knocked her a little but she was fine how ever as the years have gone on she has become less able as good expect from a woman in hers 70s and having a stroke. Last year about November time she had a fall that resulted in a stroke she ended up coming to hospital and although we went through some tough battles to get her removed from the care how she was in it got rejected and just two weeks ago she had a severe stroke that had us all gripping on or not in a way. We knew it was her time but we had to see her gripping on to life via a drip and oxygen that she did not need to prolong her life , luckily only a week went by and she passed but at the same time there were arguments and upsets not because of conflict but because of this stupid law. My mother had next to no sleep waiting for her to go at her bedside , my father being supportive to his wife and trying to not throttle my incentive 30yo brother for his blatent disregard for any ones feelings . I just hope that when my parents come to this situation hopefully in over 20 years time this will be far easier and less expensive for our country by making a passing body grip on to life they no longer have.",

Only the people with severe disability which hinders their ability to enjoy life to the full. This not only affects the person but the family around them. It *does* hurt the family seeing their relative so depressed and unhappy with life and the one thing they want cannot be granted to them. It's upsetting to see them like that, probably more than if they were euthanized. \n\nI remember seeing on the news of a guy who went to court asking to be euthanized but then 4 days later he died because he refused to eat. It's sad that he became so depressed and probably felt like he was being let down by his own country before his death.\n\nI know there's a risk that people could murder someone and say they euthanized them but there's a lot of measures which could prevent this. You could get a lawyer/police officer to come in and witness the person who wants to be euthanized sign a contract (or film them saying they would like to be euthanized if they're unable to sign it). Without the signature or the evidence, the euthanasia couldn't take place and if someone *did* murder someone but then said it was euthanasia, they'd know it was murder. Euthanasia would not be allowed if the person affected is unable to talk or sign a contract, for obvious reasons.",

This fear seems to trump the humane option of letting someone, in pain and in the last stages of a terminal illness, have a say in one of the most important incidents of their life - their death.\n\nThe issue with the LCP is somewhat different. Many of us know that something similar to this has been (informally) common practice for many years. While it is humane to let someone die peacefully without trying to squeeze the last second of life out of them, the big concerns over the LCP were the formalisation of the process and the way it was being used (targets and poor controls).",

Therefore it provides a care plan for making that person as comfortable as possible.\n\nIf a person is acutely ill, not eating or drinking BUT has the potential for recovery then LCP would not have been used and we would do everything in our power to bring them back. \n\nPeople who are going to die in a matter of hours can't really be euthanized in any meaningful way.

Whereas  euthenasia is directed more to comfort and quality of life for people in terminal or non-improving conditions (it's not limited to that by any means, but that's the thrust of it).\n\nI do understand why those are the general thoughts on it. I also understand the social ramifications if people were less discouraged from stepping away from any obligations they had by ending their life.\n\nThat said, for me, if someone feels they are done, there should be better options available. Of course offer mental healthcare, of course if it's something that can be reasonably prevented, go for it. But if someone is set on ending their life, we should be able to enable more peaceful outgoings than slashed wrists, overdoses and jumping on train tracks. Our lives are ours to live, but also ours to end.",

More generally, I would argue that there are suicides which are clearly a consequence of acute mental distress or a more long term mental illness, which are amenable to intervention, and a person who would otherwise have ended their life can go on to have a good one.  But there are also suicides where the person has a chronic life-destroying and/or degenerating condition, be it intense and unmanageable pain, massive intellectual or physical decline, or similar, such that there is no further good life to be had.  In an individualist society, we would say the right to determine when and whether that is the case is up to the individual, in a more social society, we might argue there are social responsibilities involved too, and religious people might have religious views on it.  But whichever route you take, they are clearly different beasts.  It can be argued that in some rare edge cases, someone might take their life and then shortly after a cure may be found, but it is unrealistic to expect people in extreme daily pain or living with certain conditions to just hang around for years or decades waiting for a lottery win.",

The person often isn't in their normal state of mind and wouldn't ordinarily have chosen so but is influenced by e.g. depression. If it were a medical intervention we'd they they wouldn't have the capacity to decide so. And often times with the appropriate treatment and support they can often get better and back to their normal state which isn't suicidal. I appreciate this makes assumptions about what is normal and endogenous/exogenous but its the model society mostly uses.\n\n\nWith Euthanasia done correctly though, the person's capacity and decision would be assessed by more than one expert and over a length of time to determine they are doing this autonomously with good reason.",

Over the next few decades we're going to have to deal with the rising healthcare cost from supporting the soon to be retired boomer generation. Traditionally, this wouldn't be an issue because the current working population would outnumber the older population, so you wouldn't need a radical change in taxation to cover the increased cost. But under our current taxation / budget policy, we aren't raising enough money to support them because of the disproportionate size of baby boomers in comparison to the current working population.\n\nAs a result, the government (likely the Tories) will have to make some 'tough' decisions over the next decade about how they deal with the increased cost associated with an ageing population, and when you consider who their current policies typically favour (e.g. pension triple lock), you can see that the current working population will be the one's who get shafted, Millennials and Gen Z especially.\n\nIf you want more information about this, there's a good talk here and this bit is discussed around 31:30: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuXzvjBYW8A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuXzvjBYW8A)",

I'd say my political beliefs are more centre-left and liberal, leaning towards libertarian.\n\nOut of all the political parties I can think of at the moment none appeal to me. I voted Liberal in 2010 and Labour in 2015, 2017 & 2019. The last two times I voted Labour were because I genuinely liked Jeremy Corbyn's policies and thought he had a good approach to recovering our economy. I know for a fact that I will not vote Labour until Keir Starmer goes.\n\n* Labour has abandoned its left wing grassroots followers. Keir Starmer is heavily disliked among party members because all he's really done was serve as Boris Johnson's lapdog and prop up everything he's passed through Parliament in the last year. I also hard disagree with how he's treated Jeremy Corbyn and his supporters.\n* Tories are just vile and evil. I wouldn't even mind their frugal approach to managing the economy if there wasn't so much nepotism going on behind the scenes and policies introduced to intentionally screw over the poor & vulnerable.\n* Liberal Democrats cannot be trusted and nobody will vote for them after what Nick Clegg did. Their last major manifesto under Jo Swinson was more Tory than the Tories themselves proposing shit like \"help to rent\" loans. The fact that she lost her parliamentary seat for it speaks for itself. If Clegg broke apart from the Tories when they planned to treble tuition fees, he would have absolutely saved face and would have gained a lot more respect. Heck, he may have actually won a re-election.\n* Greens **(currently the most likely party I'll vote for)** oppose nuclear power, HS2 and some of their politicians have made outright crazy proposals in Parliament like Jenny Jones's \"6pm curfew for all men.\" (I know this was suggested ironically, but it really came across as more of an attack on men in general.)\n* Socialist Worker's Party don't feel like a serious political party to me. They seem like a bunch of obnoxious marxists who picket college and university campuses. I also checked their site and they have no real policies or manifesto.\n* I'm English, so I can't vote for Plaid Cymru, Sinn Fein, the SNP or any of the other Welsh, Scottish & Northern Irish parties. I'd also have nothing to gain or lose either way from other countries leaving the Union.\n* UKIP and Brexit Party are just a bunch of racist right wingers. They're just a different shade of Tory.",

I also hard disagree with how he's treated Jeremy Corbyn and his supporters .\n\nIt kinda has to - appealing to their grass roots didn't get them a majority in parliament in any of the last 4 General Elections. They could either keep doing what they've been doing and continue to not get a majority, or try to change it up. Keir Starmer was chosen as leader to take the party in a different direction to JC, and that means JC and his crew have to be thrown out on their arses. Unfortunately, that's the reality of politics. It also helps to try to draw under the whole antisemitism debacle.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> Tories are just vile and evil\n\nStatistically, they can't all be evil. Two decent Conservative MPs that come to mind are Ruth Davidson and Rory Stewart (although Ruth Davidson is technically a Scottish Conservative, and Rory Stewart resigned from the Conservative party in 2019 and has since left politics). It's just the worst seem to tend to float to the top, but that's no different than every large political party all over the world.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Liberal Democrats cannot be trusted and nobody will vote for them after what Nick Clegg did.  If Clegg broke apart from the Tories when they planned to treble tuition fees, he would have absolutely saved face and would have gained a lot more respect. Heck, he may have actually won a re-election.\n\nI'm going to put my tin foil hat on for a minute: If you were a Conservative in the coalition government and you wanted to destroy the Lib Dems in the next election, which single policy would you pick to sabotage? The Lib Dems basically had this choice: either abandon their tuition policy and work in the coalition government for 4 more years to get their other policies through and loose a bunch of seats at the next election, or break up the coalition government immediately which would've likely have caused a snap election in which they would've lost a bunch of seats anyway. It was a no win situation. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n> Greens ... oppose nuclear power\n\nYeah, this is pretty dumb. It's a holdover from when nuclear waste was just dumped into the ocean. The UK stopped doing it in the early '80s and we've made big strides in creating safe disposal methods, but the Greens ignore it because they're still trying to court the \"nuclear = bad\" crew.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> Socialist Worker's Party don't feel like a serious political party to me \n\nThey're not. They tend to fall into the \"People's front of Judea\" group of parties.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> UKIP and Brexit Party are just a bunch of racist right wingers \n\nEh, you're not wrong.",

I’d be a lot better off if house prices were a tenth of what they are now. \n\nI can’t help thinking that this inter generational thing is misdirection. Young people are getting far worse off, yes. But are older people *in general* getting better off? No, I don’t think so. I have had a lot of luck in getting a well-paying job, but it will never be enough to buy the sort of home my parents could buy. We both lose. Young people more than my generation, yes, and by a big margin. But who benefits?",

                        "Testo della risposta": "I think you benefit by already having the opportunity to own that property, the property you own is almost certainly in positive equity by a large margin and you would have no issue financing a move because you have that equity ready to go when you want to use it. Young people have none of that.\n\nThe issue isn't moving it's getting the opportunity to own in the first place, and you being in the position of owning already is the benefit. The young are taking on all of the downsides you mentioned (stamp duty not so much if you're under the threshold for a first-time buyer, admittedly, but so few livable family homes cost under that) plus the added burden of the bar of entry being 10x higher than it was 20 years ago.\n\nI may be way off base, but I earn more than both of my parents combined (just below the 50k upper tax bracket) and the only way I can afford to buy property before I start to wrinkle is to move to Yorkshire, and even then it's a push. (which could get me started on the obvious bias of the market against single people, but I won't go there because I can only stand on so many soapboxes today)\n\nEdit: comment contains mild hyperbole",

Paying off a mortgage is effectively putting away most of the money in a savings account (albeit one that’s very difficult to access). Younger people can’t afford the small semi, which means they’re stuck renting, and paying off someone else’s mortgage. \n\nI’ve been renting a small flat for almost £850/mo for 12 years. If I’d managed to buy it 12 years ago, I’d have spent less per month on housing, and now have about £100k extra in savings/equity to help buy a house.",

If I was able to buy then and put that into mortgage repayments I would see most of that money again, and it would probably increase in value way beyond inflation, too.\n\nWhen you buy a house, eventually the mortgage payments stop and you live rent/mortgage free. When you rent it never ends.\n\nRent payments tend to be enough to cover the mortgage, maintenance, agency fees and a profit margin, so rent is much more expensive.\n\nIt is definitely better to own your home, in my opinion; and it does benefit you over lots of people stuck renting",

Certainly it was hard-going though - we all have professional finance/IT/accountancy careers and it took us years of saving - I now work in the US but I have a London flat that I couldn’t afford until I was earning £100k+ a year (work in banking/finance). So can certainly feel people’s pain on here.\n\nOn the other hand, as some other ppl have said there is a British cultural obsession with home ownership - without sounding harsh, it’s an unfortunate fact of life if you’re earning close to minimum wage you likely will be only renting. I mean I know it’s desirable to own your own home, but ultimately it’s not an inalienable right - and there is also no shame in renting, and personally I think it would be good if more people realised that. In other European countries in fact the majority of people rent rather than buy.",

I live in a town with approximately 80k residents. There are at least 80 surgeries in the central area. Each surgery has at least 2 doctors. 1k people per surgery. That's a huge number of actual doctors per head.",

Shit's just too broken right now, and we can't even argue it produces strong governments as we've had 2 hung parliaments in like 10 years. \n\nRe nationalise Rail, Water, Power. Anywhere a natural monopoly is present. Steel can remain private, it's not infrastructure. On the topic of infrastructure, I'd end Austerity when it comes to any infrastructure related things, in an attempt to help the economy.\n\nIncrease minimum wage, decrease working tax credits. All they are is state subsidisation of low wages. \n\nLegalise Cannabis, use money for NHS and treatment of addiction to more serious drugs. Earmark some money for pay rises and training for nurses and doctors, as EU ones will be leaving. Decriminalise all drugs if the amount discovered is reasonable for personal use.\n\nStay in Single market, yet leave. I'd rather 100% remain but I believe it's a healthy enough compromise. Either this or hold a referendum on exit deal, if we don't like it we remain. (Although that'd be dependent on a willing EU.)\n\nIncrease funding for schools, and also adult education. Make student loan cut off rise with inflation again. \n\nRemove public sector pay cap. Also remove triple lock. (Keep it at inflation or cost of living, to make it fairer. Re-evaluate later in term just in case.)\n\nEmpower Electoral commission more. Breaking electoral rules will come with significantly heavier penalty, including forced By-Election. \n\nIncrease funding for council house building. Try and build more private housing, but prioritise cheaper state housing so people who cannot afford rent or housing get somewhere first. Remove right to buy, or make it a lot harder. Also ensure affordable homes are actually affordable. Building one £100k house and 30 £500k houses is not an affordable development. Also prioritise flats, as they're cheaper than houses.\n\nIncrease income tax on higher earners, those over £60k per year. (Scaled increase between that and £500k.) Hopefully this, higher tax income from a higher minimum wage, and the decrease in needed tax credits, will help balance things. Although I'm sure ways could be found to balance it out more efficiently. I'd also try and close as many tax loopholes as physically possible, although that's a rather complex thing to do.",

Don't leave the EU, it was a non binding referendum, we should capitalise on the result and push for reform of the CAP etc.\n\n3. Move the UK to a full federal system, extra funding for poorer areas/allow them to set own immigration rules, new blood and new ideas will help equalise the economy. At the moment London and the poorer parts of the UK might as well be different planets.\n\n4. Set up a nationalised bank where if there was another financial crisis instead of just handing money to banks, the government buys the bad debts on the cheap and uses the tax and NI system to take a nominal sum each month until recouped, this would keep more money in the economy and not penalise people as much.\n\n5.  Massive increase in infrastructure spending especially in fast trains and renewable energy, specifically tidal power.\n\n6.  Increase immigration rates of people who can add wealth to the country especially scientists and entrepreneurs.\n\n7.  Make it easier for people to retrain in to new jobs, grants etc.\n\n8.

Here's mine:  \n  \n- Generally increase public spending, paid for through increases in income tax rates on the higher bands, and by reducing the thresholds. The NHS, social care and policing would be the priorities for this additional spending.  \n- Massively increase infrastructure investment, borrowing if necessary and taking advantage of record-low borrowing costs. Priority would be given to public transport, particularly the railways.  \n- Take the railways and buses back into public hands, through a publicly-owned private company like Deutsche Bahn.  \n- Reduce the maximum tuition fee to £4,000 a year, and restore maintenance grants for poorer students.  \n- Legalise cannabis and decriminalise other recreational drugs.  \n- Set up a bottle/can deposit scheme, better enforce littering laws, and put a 5p tax on each packet of cigarettes and chewing gum sold, with the proceeds used to fund street cleaning.  \n- Devolve further powers to Holyrood so that only international development, the constitution, security and defence are reserved.  \n- Replace the Council Tax with a more progressive tax.  \n- Offer a referendum on the agreed Brexit deal in 2019.  \n- Introduce proportional representation to the House of Commons, and remove the remaining hereditary peers and lords spiritual.",

They do stuff like clear out overgrown pathways, take action against grafitti and, at least while in power, successfully lobbied against the (Labour) council trying to cut the local park service. They even planted trees (paid out of their own pocket) to replace the ones removed by the Labour council and shamefully, the Labour councillor used taxpayer money to get the trees removed and destroyed - maybe the trees shouldn't have been replanted but still.\n\nThe local councillors (both Labour) do absolutely naff all locally, take credit for things that were either done by private firms or government money and you never see them until election time, while the Tories are active constantly even though they aren't in power. Seems odd to say it but I wouldn't be unhappy if the Tories won back the seats, though I doubt they will, it's a Labour dominated area and an incredibly safe Labour seat, held since 1992",

You'll be swamped with \"people\" ready for a lynching.\n\nI've been called a snowflake, pussy, beta-male, and all kinds of names simply because I don't think any civilised country should ever put its citizens to death, no matter how heinous their crime.\n\nPure and simple: people aren't as nice as they pretend to be when they know they're anonymous.

They're not building on that land because they literally don't have the manpower to do so, not because of some Machiavellian conspiracy to force prices up. There is a shortage of tradesmen to do the work, and until we get more in, rates of building aren't going to go up.\n\n* You can't just hammer BTL landlords. I know everyone loves to have a target to hate, but all it literally ever does is hurt tenants. Every time I point this out, I get nothing but childish rhetoric or \"hurr durr *found the landlord*\", and down votes whenever I link the RICS report showing that this is literally happening now. \n\n* People cheer for a crash. As if the world is so simplistic that you can push hundreds of thousands into negative equity (or a tiny LTV at best), damage the balance sheets on mortgages in banks and put a huge amount of precarious problems on the whole system and there will be absolutely zero consequences to you? Fucking lol. The bank wouldn't lend to you unless you had a 60% deposit and a huge salary. But they don't care. They're a mob with pitchforks and they past any semblance of rationality a long time ago.\n\nThe thing is that people do care, and are trying to solve the problem. The issue is that people have convinced themselves the problems are dead simple, and could be fixed by a half-drunk rant in a pub and when they don't see these happening in real life, they believe either nothing is being done, or it's actually some huge conspiracy.",

Between 95-98% of the UK is undeveloped, depending on exaclty how you define \"developed\". 70% of the UK is just monocrop farmland that constitutes 1% of our economy and less than 1% of employment.\n\nWe could double our housing capacity and still have 90%+ of the UK undeveloped.\n\nThe reason home building has ground to a halt (from 400,000 a year to 100,000, whilst demand grows), is because home owners went from a minority to a majority, and so there became a strong political incentive to cater to home-owners, namely restricting development through Local Planning Authorities and Town and Country Planning Acts, which keeps house prices high.\n\nFactors like cheap credit, land banks, stagnating wages are only exacerbating factors, not the cause. We have a housing shortage because its deliberate policy, because keeping houses scarce keeps them valuable and home owners like to see their homes go up in value and will crucify any government that implements policies that would crash house prices (such as removing all the legal restrictions on building that caused house building)\n\nIn an efficient free market, higher price creates higher incentive to supply. Houses being more expensive should mean that its even more profitable to turn a patch of land and a pile of bricks into a domicile. The opposite of that is happening because there is no free market in housing, because it would make housing too cheap and available which people hate once they already have a home.\n\nYou can see \"save our greenbelt\" protests all around the country now, even though the government has only slightly encouraged house building, even though all those homeowners complaining live on houses that were once built on a \"greenbelt\". It's mob rule and selfishness. Some call it democracy.",

We built ponds and stairs for primary schools. Installed paths through parks. All nice stuff like that. I loved it. I was exposed to people I wouldn't have normally been around - retirees and people with learning difficulties primarily. \n\nI got paid £55 per week because I was on a placement. The volunteers got £0 and the actual organisation did it all cheap because if you have to choose between a professional job and a nice volunteer community job, which are you going to pick if the prices are similar?\n\nIt was a really rewarding job, just not financially and it isn't exactly a career choice to do it for that level of pay for long is it? Try hard selling that to people who want to work but can't stand on their feet all day or lift heavy machinery around or shovel wheelbarrow loads of things around. \n\nHow many jobs are 1. rewarding and 2. pay well?

The ability to save has been undermined firstly by incredibly low interest rates, (where whatever your thoughts about self reliance, the received financial wisdom was it's better to borrow than save when rates are so low), and then when rates have started to rise a cost of living crisis has \"suddenly appeared\".\n\nWork nowadays for those on median or under wages offers no security, no ability to better ones position and no sense that at least at the end of it you will be able to retire with any wellbeing. \n\nIt's the unintended consequence on focusing on asset price inflation for 40 years and blaming workers for realising this is absurd.",

It is a well practiced lie based on some astoundingly robust research.\n\nImagine you do some research that says, without a doubt, that people with disabilities have a better quality of life, more positive mental health, and better treatment outcomes if they participate in \"meaningful activities\". You would want to find out what \"meaningful activities are\". So you find out what meaningful activities are. You get a long list. About one hundred and thirty or so items. That is a lot of data to manage, so you partition them into categories. One of those categories is \"jobs\". Not \"employment\". Jobs.\n\nThose jobs include, doing housework, doing gardening, doing a bit of writing - all manner of things. None of them mention \"Employment\". But they all relate to a category of Jobs. So, having identified that \"Jobs are meaningful activities\" you hand the research from the  NHS to the DWP - because the DWP know all about \"jobs\". Thus you have transformed \"meaningful activity\" from a robust piece of research that is internationally recognised and cited for its quality into a stick to beat people with: work will set you free. Which is exactly the questionable slogan that Iain Duncan Smith used to describe \"meaningful activities\" when he was eviscerating the Welfare System to install his Universal Credit Scam.\n\nEmployment is not a meaningful activity.",

The Government are pushing their 'Arbeit macht frei' ideology here quite transparently because perpetual economic growth needs a constant supply of willing victims to exploit and abuse. \n\nThat saying when you have to work and skivvy and struggle just to have some hope to survive and make it through the month, sooner or later you will crack and end up with a mental health issue and there is only so much stress, insecurity and drudgery the human mind can take and the line between sanity and insanity is wafer thin. \n\nPlease keep in mind that we're also going through a mental health pandemic as a direct consequence of COVID and lockdowns where lots of people lost jobs, lost businesses, lost homes and were forced into social isolation. People struggled with enforced isolation, loneliness, anxiety about getting infected, and anxiety over struggling with getting bills and food. Some of you might remember clapping for the NHS. There's not enough mental health support for the people who have mental health issues. The NHS only has so many psychiatrists, psychologists and therapists and getting any kind of mental health support is neither easy nor straightforward. \n\nPlease also keep in mind all the creative, community and artistic enterprises that got wiped out during COVID lockdowns. There's a lot of brilliant, creative minds that we're never going to hear from ever again because far too many people have either burned out or are about to burn out just struggling and trying to keep body and soul together. So many people are being forced to give up their passions and creative pursuits, and disciplines, simply because they're struggling for money, desperate to survive, and don't have the money, the resources, the space or the support. \n\nThink about that, no new music, no new books, no new theatre, no new films, no new culture, no new community initiatives or support, no humanitarian activism, because there's no money, investment or interest in developing such initiatives. Politicians claim to support such stuff, but won't lift a finger to support access to space, investment, funding or money. \n\nIt's all work, work, work, or get a job, get a job, get a job. Please keep in mind that COVID and lockdowns wiped out a lot of the creative and artistic industry. \n\nIt's very clear what's going on here, the Tories are trying to dismantle not just the NHS but the entire welfare state and get rid of all social security and social safety net. As they force people into work they will get rid of benefits, get rid of pensions, get rid of healthcare, and we will all be forced to work and serve to survive, or we will be destitute, homeless and left to die, penniless, destitute, isolated and used up. \n\nPeople here need a massive dose of Wake The Fuck Up and Smell The Coffee. Rest assured that once this social safety net goes all you comfortably off professional middle class types will be next. Nobody is safe in this post-Brexit political reality.",

We want to do all we can to encourage as many people as possible to stay in work with the relevant support in place to help them do so, including signposting them to that support at the earliest possible opportunity.”  \nJeremy Hunt, the Chancellor, will put getting people off out-of-work benefits and into employment at the heart of his Budget on March 15, arguing that it will help to deliver economic growth.  \nDowning Street and Treasury officials believe that the number of people out of work but who could be in employment is a major barrier to economic growth. It comes after the International Monetary Fund said that the UK was on course to be the only major economy to shrink this year.  \nSome 2.32 million people were signed off with long-term health conditions last summer, according to the Labour Force Survey. That is up from 1.95 million before the pandemic in the summer of 2019.  \nDuring that period, there was a notable rise in people signed off with mental illnesses such as phobias or nervous disorders - up from 257,000 to 313,000.  \nMusculoskeletal issues were also cited by sources as a health problem that should not necessarily mean people are permanently out of work.  \nWhitehall insiders believe that more could be done by GPs issuing sick notes that help people in such positions to keep working, providing advice on the right structures and support needed.  \nMore radical potential shake-ups, such as giving government-paid work coaches a more direct role in the sick notes system, are not expected to be adopted.  \nFinal decisions on the welfare-to-work proposals, which are being drawn up by Mel Stride, the Work and Pensions Secretary, have not yet been reached.  \nWhen he was chancellor, Rishi Sunak pushed the DWP to go further in encouraging people to move off benefits and into work. He tasked Mr Stride with the drive before Christmas.  \nTreasury insiders continue to insist that there remains little money to play with for next month’s Budget, despite the sharp fall in energy prices and signs inflation has peaked.  \nCalls from a vocal group of Tory backbenchers for tax cuts are being rebutted, with No 10 and No 11 focused instead on halving inflation this year.  \nSick notes, renamed \"fit notes\" by the Government, are official written statements from a registered healthcare professional giving their medical opinion on a person's fitness for work.  \nMany of those who are too sick to work in the long term can claim benefits from the Government to support them through financial hardship.  \nWork 'good for your health'  \nStephen Evans, chief executive of the Learning and Work Institute, said: “Good quality work can be good for your health and wellbeing, depending on your condition, and being out of work can be harmful to your health.  \n“Ensuring health professionals take full account of that in working with people to decide how much they may be able to work makes great sense.   \n“Ultimately, most people want to go back to work when they are well enough to do so, and this approach can help make that happen.”  \nMr Stride is exploring other ideas to encourage people back into work - especially for those aged over 50, whose departure from the labour market has been a notable trend since the pandemic.  \nOne idea being looked at is putting work coaches in GP surgeries, with doctors able to refer older patients who express an interest in getting a job to them for advice.  \nAnother is to introduce tax breaks for companies that take on responsibility for employee wellbeing by providing physiotherapy and mental health support.  \nMr Stride also wants to reach early retirees with financial advice, with many set to be told that they do not have enough cash to see them through life.  \nHe is seeking to substantially increase the provision of “mid-life MoTs” and is encouraging pension companies to offer them to all clients who are over 50.  \nMinisters are also working with co",

But, alas, I've not succeeded yet.  \nAnyway, I've grown tired, and come to the conclusion that for me, this world just isn't right. Yet, due to the laws surrounding euthanasia I'm unable to do anything good with my demise.  \nI'm sure some of you here about the amount of suicides there are by trains, and I fully understand why, there's not an easier alternative, but this comes with a unique downside; you scar the driver and ruin your body. Two things I don't want to do. \nWhy? Because I don't want to do more harm than I have too when leaving this world, I'd rather give my organs away, and pass away with those who'm know me knowing I got what I wanted and was happy with that choice. Not that I was forced into flinging myself into a train.\nAnyway, that's the rant. I've been looking at alternatives for a while, but for allot of them I don't have the required resources and for euthanasia in Sweden I don't tick all the boxes.  \nI'm hoping that It doesn't come to doing something that harms/scars others, but I'm afraid of not being able to find a peaceful way out. Discussion on the topic would be much appreciated, seeing others view point might allow me to decide a less devastating way of doing this.",

You could volunteer for a charity. I know a guy who works all year round then takes five weeks off to fly out to Africa, and donate a shitload of his annual earnings and five weeks of his time to a school he helps run there, although there are less extreme options like that. Whatever though, it's up to you. You could end it all, or you could give up on it all and devote your life to doing stuff that's amazing for other people, or you could stick with it, change your scenario, and hold on for the days when things get better. \n\nI'm glad I chose against suicide.

Everyone knows the salami slice tactics of law changes, and the way mission creep begins to make things more permissible which at first would have been beyond the pale and certainly never voted through if they'd been in the Act originally, so if anything this debate came years too late. The PR would have been better a few years ago.\n\nThere is a problem in this sub in that everyone has exactly the same view and the few who don't are voted down so are invisible. Remember that this is not a representation of the country, and nor of the country's future (I remember being a left-wing student too, but most people grow out of it, and many here will too) and there's a lot more to arguments than meet the eye at first. The views I see here are so confidently stated but completely simplistic, and not backed-up with proper thinking. Not that mine are any better now I'm older — just now I know that I don't know, whereas before I thought I did. Before anyone says I'd think differently if I saw suffering, my father died over a long period of time with a combination of lung cancer, alcoholism and starvation. My wife had depression for much of her 20s. One of them would have been eligible for euthanasia immediately, and my wife eventually too (no smart-aleck comments about the law not being about depression — *it would* have changed within 15 years, because that's what's happened in other countries too; once you cross the threshold which says that medicine is no longer about keeping people alive, then there is no longer a logical end anyone can agree on). You can't base political policy on anecdotes anyway.\n\nThis message is about to go downwards because it doesn't conform to the values of the group, but essentially just remember that because something is popular here it doesn't have much to say about whether it's a widely-held view beyond this sub, nor that this place has any moral high ground that other people don't. You don't need to believe me, since in my 20s I didn't either, but it's something people figure out as they get older. I'm just saying this for the record.",

In the meantime, perhaps we should be working harder on finding treatments for the people with incurable illnesses, that relieve the pain and suffering that make them want to die.

Their stance on the sick or disadvantaged is well and truly out on display and the media is running with them for the most part.\n\nI would hate to think an elderly relative chose to die because they felt pressured in any way, directly or indirectly.\n\nHowever nobody should be made to suffer when there is no cure or chance of normality if they're just living off painkillers until their body finally gives up.",

I like the fact that there is such a strong reluctance amongst our society and our religious community to accept what is a fundamental shift in how we approach life and death.\n\nThat doesn't mean that we have to accept their arguments or accept their viewpoint, but I much prefer to live in a country where people care as much as they do about the issue than where the majority of people are apathetic and don't really care about how we treat the elderly and vulnerable. \n\nIf for nothing else, the result of this pressure is that the end product will have a lot more safeguards, protections, and other mechanisms preventing a fall down the slippery slope that other people arrogantly assume the religious are wrong to worry about.\n\nYou don't get good policy through unconditional surrender and ignoring peoples viewpoints.

On her death bed, she spoke often about how glad she was that she fought through it and spent every moment possible with the people she loved.\n\n\nSo, I guess my point is that pain can distort people's perception.

In the meantime, perhaps we should be working harder on finding treatments for the people with incurable illness, that relieve the pain and suffering that make them want to die.

She reminds me of Dolores Umbridge, I can't believe anybody out there actually wants her in power?\n\n\nI think people have seen she's tried to pass a bill that demands internet service providers hand over encrypted data to the government and magically 'unencrypt them' (to those less tech-savvy she's asking the impossible, you can't decrypt without the keys to do so). This is like something straight from George Orwell's mouth or from V for Vendetta, she's an authoritarian disguised as your friendly nanny.\n\nShe also wants to ban anything that can alter your mental state (this means alcohol, if this gets out there will be riots! Our culture relies heavily on alcohol.)\n\nA few highlights of her voting record (which I believe is what we should judge MPs on):\n\n* Pro-war\n* Pro-hunting\n* Pro-climate change (how does this make sense?)\n* Wants to protect bankers (the people who destroyed our economy)\n* Reduce corporation tax\n* Against smoking bans\n* Against euthanasia for the elderly\n* Ignores reports from scientists regarding things like drug policy becuase they don't support her views",

For my money she can't be that terrible, lasting so long in the Home Office is no easy task, you end up being the public face of all the bad policy the government is trying to implement, whilst the PM owns all the good stuff. \n\nLook at the previous two [Labour] - Alan Johnson did less than a year and still found time to fire Prof Nutt after he disagreed with his drugs report.

Her voting record is absolutely identical to George Osbornes, but I think it's fair to say they don't believe the same things.

The medical model does not complement the social model of care in the manner that would allow this to occur without serious detriment to the provision of social care.\n\nCare homes wouldn't need that amount of money per week, per person if it wasn't for the fact they seek profit, huge profit. That's why hedge fund managers have invested in our care homes. \n\nThe lack of funding is glaringly purposeful. Central government wants to fuck social care so it can gut it and either sell it or add it to the ever growing undercover privatisation of health care. \n\nSocial care is fucked. Hundreds of committed social workers and social care workers try hard to get people the care they need. But their upper managers are far too involved in the politics of local government to remember their social care ethics.\n\nIt's not difficult to get into a care home if they are available, it is difficult to get the Care Act right of choice though. Yes you do have to pay if you own over 23k in savings, but that's a fair amount of money tbh. You needn't lose your house over it if you've taken advice prior to being care, which you should do btw, ask about trusts and social care. Also your house is safe if your partner lives there or for a variety of other reasons.\n\nDon't let the government fuck up social care any more than it already has.",

                "Testo del commento": ">The National Health Service (NHS) in England is under unprecedented strain. So it is baffling that more than one in ten of its beds are occupied by patients who do not need them. Some 13,600 inpatients are medically ready to be discharged yet remain in hospital—more than double the number five years ago. This is bad for them, as unnecessary stays tend to weaken patients and increase their susceptibility to infection. It is even worse for the sick people waiting outside in ambulances, queuing in record numbers to get in.\n\n>Discharging a patient requires a dizzying amount of administrative work, with doctors, social workers and managers all having to sign off. Much of this bureaucracy is still done on paper. “It is easier to track a pizza than it is our patients across health and social care,” says John O’Connell, who is leading an NHS pilot scheme to digitise the discharge process. One problem, however, cannot be solved by technology. Increasingly, when patients are ready to leave, there are no carers available to look after them.\n\n>In 2021 the number of workers in adult social care fell by 50,000, the first decline in the decade that there have been records. There are 165,000 vacancies; one in 11 posts is unfilled. As the workforce dwindles, so does the quantity and quality of care on offer. The proportion of older people receiving state-supported long-term care is decreasing, but this does not seem to be because their needs are diminishing. Public satisfaction with social care, always lower than with the NHS, fell from 29% three years ago to a dismal 15% in 2021.\n\n>Frustration stems in part from a complicated system. Long-term social care, consisting of both in-home care and care in nursing and residential homes, is supplied by thousands of mostly private providers. It is difficult to get publicly funded care. In order to qualify, a person must typically be deemed by their local authority to have both high needs and assets of less than £23,250 ($28,100). Separate funding streams hobble efforts to integrate the NHS and the social-care system: money for social care is still primarily funnelled to local authorities through the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, not the Department of Health.\n\n>More fundamentally, in the decade from 2010 the funding of local authorities fell by half in real terms. Some losses were made up by rises in local council tax and by the introduction of a special social-care “precept”, or levy. But in 2020-21 prices, social-care spending still fell from £514 per adult citizen in 2010-11 to £478 per adult citizen ten years later.\n\n>Josh Hawker of AbleCare Homes, which runs six care homes in the south-west, says his firm needs £800-1,000 per week to look after a client. That seems cheap given that it costs the NHS at least £2,500 per week to keep someone in hospital. But Mr Hawker says that Bristol city council pays £771 for each state-funded client, almost irrespective of their needs. The “council just aren’t paying what it costs to look after people”, he says. Self-funders, who make up the remaining third of residents, end up paying more to subsidise others.\n\n>The miserliness exerts downward pressure on wages. At £9.50, the median hourly wage of a care worker is less than that for an easier job stacking shelves at a supermarket. One of Mr Hawker’s employees had been an “excellent” care worker for a decade, he says. But when she quit to start an entry-level job as an administrator in the NHS, she instantly received a pay bump of 30%. When they are unable to find replacements, some providers fill the gaps with exorbitantly priced agency staff. Others make do with a smaller workforce.\n\n>The losers are society’s elderly and most vulnerable. Age UK, a charity, estimates that around 2.6m adults who need some kind of care are not receiving it. In the first three months of 2022, 2.2m hours of home care could not be delivered because of a shortage of staff. Providers such as Right at Home, a home-care franchise, are increasingly focusing on self-funding clients. “It means we can pay our workers more,” says Lucy Campbell, the CEO. Those who cannot afford such services may have to go without, or rely on unpaid carers instead.\n\n>Care homes must contend with soaring energy costs as well as worker shortfalls. That means making tough choices. At best, carpets grow shabbier and walls aren’t repainted. At worst, clients with more complex (ie, costlier) needs are turned away. Profit margins are at their lowest since the Care Quality Commission, a regulator, began monitoring them in 2015. “You’d be mad to open a care home at the moment,” says Mr Hawker.\n\n>The autumn statement on November 17th did bring some relief. Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor of the exchequer, pledged up to £7.5bn of extra money for social care over two years, a chunk of which will come from allowing local authorities to raise council tax. Around a third of the money is tied to hospital discharges, to be split with th",

Austerity isn't a choice, it is a fact of life one way or another. You either pay more taxes and are poorer, you borrow more and make your children poorer, or reduce public services and are poorer. I know, I know, there are a lot of economically left wing publications who tell you this isn't true but in my opinion, they're all deluding themselves thinking there is a free magic money tree.\n\nThe fact is that western nations have previously enjoyed very high standards of living compared to the developing world and a lot of that was on income borrowed from the future (us in case you missed that point). We are now suffering the consequences of this and it has to play out, there is no other way. I don't want to repeat those same mistakes and kick the can down the road to our children to pay for.\n\nTrust me, I'm as infuriated as you at the situation. But I recognise it differently to you. I recognise that there are a bunch of older people who enjoyed enormous benefits and reaped all the rewards of a period when world growth was very high. But now we, the younger generation have been left holding the debt and must pay for an ageing population.",

I'd love to see some sort of overhaul to the system where those who can afford it *really* pay for their own retirement. For example, my parents finished paying off their property many years ago and have several generous pensions funded - they don't need their state pension. Also, myself and my brothers are doing well for ourselves so don't 'need' their inheritance... I will encourage my parents to use their property to fund to most comfortable retirement they can.",

To sustain the current model would cost a lot more in tax. That can either come from the well off (political suicide) or the plebs (political suicide) so instead the tories tinker around with sticking plasters like mucking about with council tax. \n\nEven if we could raise enough tax, automation will deal another savage blow to the system in 20 years or so. \n\nTime for a full and frank reappraisal of how our society works, and specifically the entitlement to the surplus generated that certain people have a sense of. For example;\n\nAmazon has recently opened shops with no staff. There are plans afoot for drones to be used for delivery. Robots can 'pick' orders all night without collapsing or running to the unions. Driverless technology will soon make bulk deliveries by AI plausible. Tesco et al will doubtless follow suite to stay competitive.\n\nIn short, it's not out of the realms of possibility that the world's largest retailers will be able to operate with just a layer of senior management paying themselves ever larger salaries whilst the people who would have worked for them do...... what exactly?\n\nIf we're not careful, we'll wind up with an Elysium type scenario; educated people selling value add services to other educated people whilst the rest of the world gets forgotten about. \n\nNo doubt the Elysians will feel that they got there through their own brilliance but of course this is bollocks. The advances which will allow this to happen come from research and development often paid for by publically funded universities, using publically funded infrastructure and people who were educated in the state system. Not to mention the fact that harvesting all of the surplus will deny ordinary people the opportunity to make a living. \n\nWe need to talk seriously about redistribution. The onset of automation and technological could usher us into a paradise where ordinary people are freed from toil and illness and can lead long, fulfilling lives furthering the human race through increased access to education and the time and resources to take advantage of it.\n\nInstead, I fear we're being ushered into an age where an ever smaller group of people will horde an ever greater amount of resources while the rest of us can go fuck ourselves. \n\nDon't let this happen people.",

I know Amazons FCs with robotics still require a human picker. The robots make the picking process more efficient by moving shelving to the picker. This is also only more efficient when dealing with small items. With regular or large sized items the traditional setup of the picker moving around is most efficient for now.",

Most of the politicians seemed to be against it because they felt that necessary safeguarding measures could not be put in place properly to ensure that the person was not pressurised into it, or making a rash decision.\n\nHaving said that, Dignitas have a very thorough system with multiple appointments with doctors, background and mental health checks etc, and I see absolutely no reason why something similar cannot be done in the UK. It is not something that will happen overnight, and despite overwhelming public support, most politicians seem reluctant to speak out on the issue.\n\nI think that it is disgusting that someone who is terminally ill, suffering and wanting to end their life has to travel to Switzerland to do it - and the many people who can't afford it have to stay here and suffer. That is undignified and unjust. I don't think anyone has a right to refuse someone the choice to end their life, but I think as a society we also have a duty to do all we can for them and make sure that their decision is both a personal and rational one.",

Empty. Soulless. I admire Peter's decision, and his resoluteness, but I find I can't actually admire the way he died. The beige room. The wife sidelined by the helper/supporter in his last moments. The rasping request for water, that was denied (although I understand why).\n\nAlthough I certainly won't deny that I was moved by the experience of watching a man end his life, the thing that drew a tear was the banality of it all. A man's life. 71 years of memory, and experience. Of **life.** Ended. On camera, and broadcast to a nation. Yet it all felt so damn pathetic.\n\nMaybe that was the point.\n\nShit, I don't know.

Frankly, if the roles were reversed I'd want to kill myself before it was too late because I might not have the same family there to return the favour of him tirelessly slaving away and taking care of us all those years. I mean he's happy enough now but he used to get pretty upset as he was fading away, knowing it would happen eventually and there was nothing he could do to stop it. Such a smart, kind, funny, happy man full of life reduced to a daze. Thankfully, ignorance is bliss.",

Euthanasia is assisted suicide for people who can make a conscious decision to end their life but who usually lack the physical ability to do it themselves.\n\nFrom what you are saying your family member lacked the consciousness to make any sort of decision about death. Are you saying that another family member should have taken that decision for him? Your post is not clear where you stand on assisted death which is so often the problem with this debate. So many people just want it legalised on moral grounds and to hell with the consequences.",

Basically this practice sedates the patient with drugs so that they are no longer conscious and allows the person to die naturally without the doctor or nurse taking an active role in it. Now there is an example of it being mismanaged in that article so this is why I am still apprehensive about this and would want stricter controls.\n\nWith euthanasia the biggest worry for me is that people could have their cases mismanaged and die when, unlike with CDS patients, they could still have several healthy and active weeks/months left.\n\n I know this sounds a little far fetched but to be honest I'm a little worried about getting to a stage where people can be euthanised for ailments that are not terminal. The [report](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24373107) on that Belgian Transsexual that elected to be euthanised due to his depression over a botched sex change truly was horrifying in my opinion.",

And I just wanted to add my own perspective too:  \n\nMy mother in law has had extremely bad dementia for the past five years, to the point that she is completely dependent on us for all her needs (however she was able to look round and laugh and smile, just to give you an idea).  Six weeks ago she had a massive bleed on her brain and became semi-conscious and unable to swallow.  In hospital we had to beg the doctors to put her on a fluids drip so she would not die.  (She has had smaller strokes before and recovered).  They said it was not 'in her best interests'.  Eventually they agreed, and anyway a couple of days later she regained her swallow.  She is eating spoons of pureed food now.  She is not in a good state.  I am not saying anyone would want to exist in a state like that.  But we are basically stuck between feeding her like that, or not feeding her.  They have all these euphemisms like 'just keep her comfortable' and what's in her 'best interests'  what they mean is she is better off dead but they won't actually do anything about it.  There is morphine available but I don't think it would be given unless she is in discomfort, not sure, but that is not a quick clinical solution anyway.  No one has the courage to face this issue head on.  \n\nI have been anguished about the notion of essentially watching her starve to death, which is what will happen when her swallow goes.  I have been reassured that the body is not feeling hunger at that stage and that the body systems are just shutting down naturally, which gave me some comfort.  But still I wonder, how do they know that for sure?",

People talk about the potential for abuse but other countries and some US states allow assisted dying and they have not seen cases of abuse.
