Thanks to Ale for today's idea and thanks to all of you for joining. I couldn't have grown up with better friends, even Tola!!! Ahahahahah 🤪 I believe in reincarnation, so I believe that we will meet again and it will once again be a pleasure and an honor. Meanwhile, Tola behave!!! 😂 Guys, earthly life is a game, sometimes a bit of a dick, but enjoy it as much as you can. And fuck vegans. I love you all from the bottom of my heart and whatever happens after death, I am sure that you will always be in my heart and that, in one way or another, I will always remember each of you.\n\nLife is Beautiful.\n\n**P.SS You FUCK support euthanasia!! Because, you see, when there is no cure or you are terminal, euthanasia should not, ever, be called suicide. Euthanasia, in these cases, is an act of clemency, mercy and, ultimately, kindness**.\n\nI hug you all.\n\nAh!!! I told my mother to organize something like refreshments or something at my house after the passing away!!!! ☺\n\nAh!!! My house will be available for a few more months and I would like it to be used!!! Enjoy it, have a barbecue, a dinner with friends, a romantic dinner... it's available!!! ☺💞❤\n\nAnd then the next morning she wrote this,\n\n\\*\\*They gave me one option: I can ask to be permanently sedated in a combination of a powerful sleeping pill plus painkiller (usually morphine) for days until I die, essentially from starvation.\n\nHow horrible and cruel.\n\nGuys, I know it doesn't affect you directly, but raise hell for euthanasia, and not with the ridiculous online petitions that only serve to collect emails...\\*\\*\n\nStefy, the signatures of our dirty dozen are yours :-(\n\n&#x200B;\n\nthank you for the awards, thank you from the bottom of my heart, but I would rather ask you to sign it if it really had legal validity (I still have to read the article and understand if it is valid or rubbish).\n\nLet's become a more civilized nation!",

As a counter-proof we could take Canada or Finland, even wealthier, where civil rights are more talked about.\n\n\nThe guy isn't wrong, but it's a shame that he throws it on the rich/poor social struggle, and not as a sign of general national well-being (despite the thousand difficulties).",

Furthermore, a person who indulges you (or even encourages you) to \"leave\", in my opinion, is a person who has no consideration for you. I understand very well what it means to be depressed or suffer existential crises, but as much as we want to be \"proud\" and maintain our dignity, we cannot ignore the fact that, above all indirectly, we send signals for help because the real need in these situations is \"get better\" and/or feel GOOD. I'm not the type who believes 100% that \"standard\" suicide or euthanasia (in this case) is selfish, but it must be said that actually and, objectively, it is a bit.\n\n\"Dying is like being stupid: only others suffer\" cit.\n\nEDIT: **BEFORE PUTTING A DOWNVOTE,** **READ BELOW.

I was thinking of involving an old football star from my city (with the slogan 'this time I'm asking for the autograph'). What do you think? Could I reach him through IG? He seems very human, I hope he gives it a few hours, it would be a spatial sounding board.\nI see many who say they will sign and it's really nice, if you feel like it try to share it with friends and family, even the most daring on social media. If you have friends who are lawyers or bother them in common, there is a real need for authenticators. For lawyers, this is quite simple as they can collect signatures throughout the country, even on the beach.\n\nCrazy thought: Ritaly has 300k members, we'll be enough to get 60% of the necessary signatures.\n\nGo and sign, long live Freedom.",

Ah, well, then euthanasia is the only solution\"\n\nBullshit aside, there's nothing to laugh about here. I had given my opinion regarding euthanasia for people who suffer for PSYCHOLOGICAL reasons resulting in turn from depression (depending on the stage), existential crises etc.\n\nEDIT: little introduction that I forgot to write. THE UNDERSIGNED IS IN FAVOR OF EUTHANASIA.\n\nBefore judging me without really knowing me (as many have done without thinking twice), I would like to inform you that the undersigned KNOWS WELL what the things written above mean and that the light at the end of one's tunnel of life can be seen even though it is still a long way off. far away.\n\nMy opinion was based on the fact that a person apparently no longer had the will to live and that therefore there could finally be a solution to his existential agony. Among various things, I tried to say that in any case we must try to improve ourselves and/or ask for a hand (even if the refusal of other people's help in these situations is understandable). Thinking of euthanasia as the definitive solution (**PLEASE NOTE: ALWAYS IN THIS CONTEXT**) is for LAZY people. I define this last sentence well, because I understand that it is not easy to transcribe it and that it may not be exactly easy to understand. By \"lazy\" person I don't mean someone who doesn't feel like doing shit in general, but simply someone who IGNOREs the possibilities of improving their life. Like the \"mantra\" I wrote at the beginning, people have said almost all kinds of things to me, thinking that I was against euthanasia in general, that for me people don't suffer and that I don't understand empathy.\n\nNow. I understand being outraged by \"such an affront\", but first understand who you are talking to. To define myself, in exact words, as a \"pooping person\" because I do not \"accept\" euthanasia for those who suffer (so, immediately to generalize because perhaps it is convenient) is not for intelligent people since the undersigned could define you in the same way \"beings\" because you don't know that I have actually been through these things.\n\nAnd speaking of ** EMPATHY **, for those who aren't aware, empathy does not mean RECOGNIZING and SUPPORTING others and their state of mind. Empathy means **UNDERSTANDING** and, where possible, **HELPING**.\n\nYep, **help**. Just as there are professional figures such as psychologists who help people not only to overcome the current problems that afflict them, but also to **PREPARE THEM FOR FUTURE PROBLEMS**.\n\nSigning in favor does not give you the civil status of a \"model citizen\" or the classic \"I did my part!\". You have made your contribution in allowing \\[HOPEFULLY IT WILL BE LIKE THIS ONE DAY\\] something that would absolutely help many people, but that doesn't justify you not **helping**, where you can, others just because there 'is the \"final solution\". From the series: you chose the easy way out.\n\nLet's be clear, no one asked to be born and life is difficult and senseless for EVERYONE. There is no \"yes or no\". But if we can try or try again to LIVE WELL, it's worth doing and if we can lend a hand to those who are (I dare say) less fortunate, let's do it.

Personally, I am not terminally ill, but many people I know (myself included) are in favor of euthanasia because the idea of ​​having to find yourself in an incredibly shitty situation where you are destined to suffer for months and months and then die with certainty is still scary. absolute.\n\n2. It doesn't matter who promotes the idea, but the idea itself. Hitler cared about animal ethics, but it's not like we can throw it all away just because Mr. Adolf tended to spout extremist bullshit.\n\n3. \"Pitiful\" cases that can potentially happen to any of us. And there has always been profit for any bullshit, just think of the fake support of the LGBT community by multinational corporations. It's not like we're revoking their rights because someone is making money off of them. I don't deny that euthanasia can potentially lead to a small profit problem, but it certainly does not justify the total prohibition of the possibility of euthanasia for those who really need it. At this point we directly abolish all prisons because statistically a couple of people out of millions have been unjustly incarcerated.\n\n4. These regimes attacked various minorities who certainly did not want to die and were not suffering and dying. You certainly can't compare it to people who beg and beg to die a little sooner if the only alternative for them is to live a couple more months in excruciating suffering.\n\n5. Huh? I'm honestly confused, I don't know what you mean by this point.\n\n6. Euthanasia does not apply ad dime, simply being old is not a criterion for being qualified to do it. Same thing for simple invalids who are not in danger of life and are not in a vegetal state (vegetative? The term escapes me lol).\n\n7. In Italy there is freedom of speech. You also have the right to say that someone has a shitty opinion (after all, the same ultra-religious people do it all the time, just look at comments like that gays should disappear from the face of the earth). And if you are against it, you can always refuse to be euthanized if given the option.",

For a depressed person, the biggest obstacle to suicide is having to do it yourself. If you allow a depressed person to die at the hands of another person I believe that many more would do so and I don't know if this is a good or a bad thing (I say this literally, not rhetorically: the pro would be to set more people free, the the downside would be that many people who have recovered from depression consider themselves lucky to have avoided death)",

        "Testo del post": "The detailed reasons that led to the rejection of three of the eight referendums that were presented and discussed on 15 February have been published [on the Constitutional Court website](https://www.cortecostituzionale.it/default.do).\n\n# Euthanasia\n\nAs regards the question on euthanasia ([sent. 50/2022](https://www.cortecostituzionale.it/actionSchedaPronuncia.do?anno=2022&numero=50)), as already anticipated, the problem would lie in the lack of \"protection minimum\" to the right to life that would result in the case of abrogation of the crime of murder of a consenting person.\n\nNow, the Court specifies first of all that the request for a referendum is an act without motivation, and therefore in judging whether it is admissible or not one must look only at the proposed text, and not at any declarations of any kind from the promoting committee:\n\n>As this Court has clarified, «the referendum request is an act without motivation and, therefore, **the objective of the signatories of the referendum must be deduced** not from the declarations possibly made by the promoters \\[...\\], but exclusively **from the purpose \"incorporated in the question\"**, i.e. from the purpose objectively obtainable based on its formulation and the impact of the referendum on the regulatory framework of reference \\[...\\]».\n\nHaving said this, what does the referendum say? This proposed to target the crime of murder of a consenting party ([art. 579 c.p.](https://www.brocardi.it/codice-penale/libro-secondo/titolo-xii/capo-i/art579.html)), appropriately cutting out some parts in such a way that this was punished (with the provisions relating to 'normal' murder) *only* if the victim was a minor, a person in a state of mental deficiency or whose consent was extorted with violence or deception; thus remaining silent on the remaining cases, after the repeal.\n\nFor the Court, this would mean that, following the repeal of the crime of consenting murder, *any* killing of consenting people would become legal:\n\n>The objective result of the success of the referendum initiative would therefore be **that of making the killing of a person with the person's consent criminally lawful,** outside of cases in which the consent is invalid due to the incapacity of the person offended or due to a flaw in his training.\n\nThis also outside of just cases of euthanasia:\n\n>In light of the resulting legislation, the \"liberalization\" of the fact would regardless of the reasons that may lead to requesting one's own death, **which should not necessarily be linked to a body prisoner of a state of illness** with particular characteristics, being able to also connect to situations of discomfort of a completely different nature (emotional, family, social, economic and so on), up to the mere taedium vitae, or even to choices that imply, in any case, the acceptance of one's own death at the hands of others .\n\nThe defense of the promoting committee, according to which this is not true because the only possible consent in such a situation is still that given in a medical context according to a procedure already defined by law, was rejected on the grounds that, when the murder of the consenting person is abrogated for all cases, then there is no longer an obligation to subordinate the validity of the consent to that procedure, which therefore could be given in any form, for any reason:\n\n>Given the limitation of the criminal relevance of the murder of a consenting party only to the hypotheses expressly indicated by the current third paragraph of the art. 579 cod. pen., **nothing would authorize us to believe that the exemption from liability remains subordinate to compliance with the \"medicalized procedure\"** prefigured by law no. 219 of 2017 for the expression (or revocation) of consent to therapeutic treatment (or refusal thereof).\n\nFinally, after having once again underlined that what the promoting committee thinks is worthless (and in particular the fact that the referendum only serves as a push to induce Parliament to legislate), the Court justifies its power to intervene.\n\nIn fact, although it is true that the admissibility judgment should not be a preventive check of constitutional legitimacy on the legislation that would result following a yes victory, it is also true that the Court cannot admit questions that would undermine the minimum constitutionally guaranteed protection of some fundamental rights, such as the right to life in this case:\n\n>Subsequently, sentence no. 35 of 1997 also referred this last hypothesis to those «ordinary laws **the elimination of which would lead to the suppression of a minimum protection** for situations that require such protection according to the Constitution» \\[...\\].\n\nOf course, this does not mean that the crime of consenting murder is the *only* possible way to protect life.\n\nBut for this type of law, which the Court calls \"constitutionally necessary\"",

There was a study behind it, involving legal experts).\nFor anyone who thinks that what is supported by the Constitutional Court is the most correct interpretation possible, in reality in my opinion Cappato brings some very strong arguments to question the court's justifications.\n\nIn particular, for example on the cannabis referendum, the Court makes extensive use of references to international treaties, but Cappato points out that although other countries have signed those treaties, they have still legalized those substances (cannabis, but also coca leaves, for example ). And they have had no problems whatsoever with the rest of the world following legalization.\n\n\nPersonally, I too have difficulty not seeing political will behind it after Amato's press conference and despite the fact that legalization has already taken place in other countries.\n\nIt is very dangerous to simply read the court's statements and conclude \"ok, that's fine, it makes sense, let's close this story without thinking carefully about it\"",

However, even the referendum on the murder of a consenting person does not introduce anything new into our system: of course, it would be new not to punish those who kill someone with their consent, and in any case it was rejected for other reasons... but it at least preserves the nature abrogation of the referendum (look at that) abrogation, given that in any case there is a behavior now punished as a crime and no longer in the future, if the yes vote had won.\n\nBut for the one on the civil liability of magistrates it was simply impossible to ignore the thing, because it clearly aims to introduce a new concept rather than simply remove things that are already there.",

If this law were to pass, it would become possible for doctors to even stop treating a terminally ill patient, which is currently prohibited.\n\nThe law on euthanasia is already required after the ruling in Cappato by the Constitutional Court, but without this step a situation like the one in Switzerland would be created (the doctor prescribes the drug but cannot administer it, because it would be murder). Therefore it does not directly allow euthanasia but simplifies the legal process by removing one of the main limitations.\n\nDepending on how you want to legislate euthanasia or not, we could talk about assisted suicide (therefore without serious pathologies), but I see it as hard for everything to pass in one fell swoop. After this referendum we will be able to talk about the possibility for doctors to pull the plug even without a living will, perhaps even the possibility of voluntarily causing the patient's death (if authorized) depending on which side the parties take, but not about assisted suicide.\n\nThe purpose of the referendum is to change the law to remove the obstacle, then it is up to the parties to make the new law. Meanwhile, the practice would end up in a gray area in view of legalization",

Cappato explains well that euthanasia is a serious process, so there is a lot of multi-sectoral work in which various professionals make sure that the individual's discomfort cannot be resolved in any way.\nAs he himself points out, there are cases in which people contacted him, but then he changed his mind because he realized that what she was missing was pain therapy, or therapeutic support from psychologists. If there is no way to resolve the issue, then I think euthanasia is right when there is no therapy in sight.\n\nWhat we talked about last time was specifically euthanasia in the case of depression, which I don't agree with at all due to the simple fact that we certainly have therapies in sight, but they are not being exploited. Furthermore, Cappato himself underlines the importance of trying to resolve the issue in another way first, without therefore immediately complying with the desire of the person requesting euthanasia. I also agree with this position, while the other time we happened to discuss it, if I remember correctly, it seems to me that your position (or that of other users) was to respect the will of the person with absolute priority, therefore without try other solutions first.

Flick underlines the absurdity of maintaining unchanged the crime of aiding suicide (which the Constitutional Court has only partially annulled, restricted to patients suffering from unimaginable suffering), while at the same time the crime of murder of the consenting person, which he points out is in a certainly any sense *'more serious'* than simple aid to suicide would become legal.\n\nFlick does not make predictions, but at the same time he does not deny the hypothesis that, due to these difficulties, the Constitutional Court may not authorize the referendum even though the target of five hundred thousand signatures has already been largely exceeded.",

From another point of view, it is true that going in that direction can lead to important consequences, which go far beyond the extreme case of the terminally ill.

I also think of terminally ill cancer patients, who suffer greatly in the last period of their lives. What if they had the choice to leave before they got to that level of pain?",

You could end up in a vegetative state suddenly without even having the chance to say \"I want to go to Switzerland\". This could force us to remain in a state of suffering for years or get a relative of ours into trouble should they decide to help us.

[...] It is not even clear whether Noa Pothoven was accompanied in her death by deep sedation...\"\r\n\r\nMaybe in this case it's different. But in the Netherlands there is a practice called *versterving*, which is not euthanasia - that is, a practice in which life is actively ended. But one in which you are left to die of consumption. That is, depriving the dying person of food *and* hydration. All under deep sedation, because dying without being able to drink must be terrifying. In the proper and translated sense.\r\n\r\nI know this because the grandfather of an acquaintance of mine - terminally ill with cancer - was terminated in this way. He didn't want any therapeutic fury, but he had also apparently expressed a clear refusal of euthanasia. And yet... And since - apart from the tumor - he was of robust constitution, it lasted like a week. So much so that the guy-pain aside-there was some guy left, but he was killed!\r\n\r\nObviously not. Or rather, legal protocols and procedures were followed. However, if I understand correctly, it was the doctors who had decided / strongly advised the family members for this choice. My impression - from his story - was really that not even the family members had any say in the matter. The thing was presented as if it were a medical practice like any other. Why is it done like this.\r\n\r\nThen I am against not euthanasia itself - which in the end is an individual choice - but a law that regulates it.

This isn't about patching up someone who in a moment of despondency attempted suicide, to commit suicide by not eating you have to be sure, as it's a long process and not without suffering. Psychological support is the only thing that is useful, and ethical, to give. If your suffering is greater than that of hunger there is little that can be done.

        "Testo del post": "I originally wrote about coffee, but they told me to create a separate thread on the topic... and, well, here I am. The main question is the one you see in the title: is the referendum on euthanasia, precisely, *about 'euthanasia'*? Or will it also have effects on cases of consenting homicide that have ***nothing*** to do with the medical field?\n\nLet me explain: the referendum, in case you didn't already know, affects the crime of murder of a consenting person ([art. 579 c.p.](https://www.brocardi.it/codice-penale/libro-secondo/titolo- xii/capo-i/art579.html)), which currently punishes anyone who kills a person with that person's consent (unlike all other situations in which a right is infringed with the permission of the person who holds it, in which case you are never punishable); it is then specified that the murder of a consenting person is punished as normal murder if it is committed against a minor or mentally ill person (incapable of giving consent), or if consent is obtained by force, threat or deception.\n\nWhat would the Luca Coscioni Association like to do? If you read the text of the referendum before signing the proposal, then you will know that approximately 70% of this article would be repealed: only the part that says that normal homicide would be prosecuted in those three cases (minors, mentally ill, consent obtained fraudulently). But then where am I wrong? Because, for one thing, in another thread everyone downvoted me for giving the example of two American guys (an episode you may know) who had met on an online forum, the first with the fantasy of being eaten and the second of being a cannibal. You can imagine how it ended: in Italy the latter (the 'survivor') would be punished for murder of the consenting person... but after the referendum? That article of the penal code would basically no longer be there, after all. Yet it is not a case study of euthanasia.\n\nOn another thread they told me that in reality they do it on purpose to 'leave a regulatory gap', so Parliament will have to immediately fill it with legislation on euthanasia. But... are we talking about the same Parliament that the Constitutional Court, after the ruling on Cappato, had given **one year** to fix the crime of aiding suicide? Did a year go by in vain without them even starting the process to touch on that topic? If the referendum were to pass (ending up also touching on areas that have nothing to do with the medical one), I'm pretty sure that no less time would pass before even the *idea* of spending time plugging the holes created would arise. in the penal code.",

And I'll update the post (to avoid double questions).\n\nSmall clarifications on the video:\n\n* \"accabbadora\" = \"she who finishes\". \"Accabbare\" means \"to finish\". Not just life eh, even in general.\n\n* \"sacrament\" = \"oil\" = extreme unction.\n\n* \"su jualeddu\" = \"the yoke\" was a miniature of the yoke used for oxen. It had a ritual meaning and was used by all accabadores\n\n* the lady, when she speaks in Italian, is clearly translating word for word from Sardinian (for those interested, it is a dialect of the Logudorese). So some sentences seem rambling (but there are subtitles). They sound like \"How you call you\" for \"what's your name\" just for example.",

As far as I know, they don't require compensation of any kind.\n\nObviously the figure of the accabbadora is very different and certainly more clinical, but there is always something mythological that links Sardinian women to medicine which I find very fascinating.",

There is not enough space between the tram tracks and the platform of the stop and obviously the tram cannot widen to avoid you. I know it shouldn't be done but I'd rather cause minimal inconvenience than an accident.\n\nFurthermore, of course there is a very long cycle path on the Martesana, as well as in Corso Buenos Aires, but in some sections there are 200m and then that's it, especially in the centre.

Just don't stay on the tracks and, if necessary, cross them WHERE REQUIRED.\n\nSo yes, we can also say that there are few cycle paths, that cars should go at 30km/h and everything you like, but the reality is that what we should do is actually fine people who cycle against traffic, who doesn't use cycle paths where they exist, who hinders traffic on fast roads and everything else.\n\nWhen cyclists get out to cross at pedestrian crossings and don't burn the traffic lights because those are for cars, then we can talk about how to improve the infrastructure.",

The road that leads to the two main poles is horrible: the lanes are narrow (two trucks/SUVs barely pass each other), as soon as the lanes end there is grass (cut a couple of times a year) and the limit is 90km/h (which no one respects).\n\nSince these companies opened (5-6 years) there has been traffic of cyclists, there are already around ten people injured and a couple dead. Every year we ask to create a cycle path and the answer is just a rebound of responsibility and of little interest. Among other things, the municipalities at the ends of the road are already connected to two different networks of cycle paths (to join the river parks), so it would also make sense on an urban planning level to create that cycle path.\n\nFor now we limit ourselves to counting the deaths and listening to motorists complain about the presence of cyclists, as if they loved being grazed by trucks and high-speed cars",

Worse than not having cycle paths is having cycle paths made by those who understand nothing about them, which have the opposite effect of proving the detractors right. In various cities where I have lived I have seen tracks thrown there haphazardly because it's cool to do them but beware of pissing off the motorists, who have done more damage and caused more accidents than before and proved the detractors right \"well, you wanted the tracks and then this is the result. We were right not to want them.\"\n\nTo re-establish Italian roads, we need processes that are a standard with stringent constraints to which no administrator can make changes. Standard that must be developed by those who are free from electoral pressure.\n\nIt makes no sense to have unprotected tracks with cars whizzing by, tracks that are interrupted or have diversions every 100 metres, pedestrian/cycle paths that are not interconnected and you are forced to travel through traffic and so on. The same road system and infrastructure should be designed to favor bikes first and then cars. I still remember when I lived in Viale Marconi (Rome) but I was forced to take a car or bus to reach EUR. I was literally less than 2km away, but it was absolutely impossible for me due to the shape of the roads.\n\nBut it also doesn't make sense how cities are expanding. If we really wanted to discourage the use of the car, the bike must always be convenient, at any time of day and for any activity. I have to be able to load it on the train without it being a nuisance, I have to be able to park it and walk around and then find it again, I have to be able to reach supermarkets, shops and other activities easily.\n\nIn short, it is clear that all the proclamations \"we need new mobility\" are, for the moment, just casual phrases to be said following the accident.

Sometimes it's really hard, but I know that in the long run things get better and this pushes me, at least unconsciously, to move forward.\n\nAt a certain point\n\nyou must understand\n\nthan the pain you suffered\n\nyou don't have to suffer it\n\nendlessly.\n\nGo on holiday,\n\npoor adult life\n\nhe cannot pay indefinitely\n\nchildhood debts.\n\nDeclare your sins over,\n\nthe sentence was served.\n\nFrom now on every day\n\nit will be like before\n\nbut inside you\n\nclearer and truer, clearer\n\nand sincere.\n\nYou only owe the greatest possible sweetness\n\nwho will come and who will go.\n\nIt's celebration in your heart,\n\ncelebrate in some way\n\nthe hearts of others.\n\n*F.

I chose Feltrinelli since I have a lot of books on my wish list. Two weeks* ago I decide it's time to spend these 100 euros, and I place a nice massive order, halving my wish list.\n\nSince I knew that I would be in the office these days, and that the concierge is not at my house this week, I have everything delivered to my mother's house, what a notice (estimated delivery date: 15-18 February)\n\nLast night I was about to go to sleep, when out of caution I decided to look at the status of the shipment. It appears delivered.\n\nI then wrote to my mother to ask if GLS had passed, but she too wasn't at home yesterday. When you returned, you saw some packages thrown haphazardly inside the gate, but since you knew that my package would arrive later in the week, you thought they were packages from condominium owners. Evidently the courier didn't even wait for someone to answer the intercom (no one would have answered, because the house was empty), but she simply threw the packages over the gate (thank goodness I never order fragile things).\n\nOh well, no problem, you'll say: your mother could have gone out to collect the package last night and she died right there. With the only exception that yesterday, *for the first time in over two months*, it rained. While my package, with one hundred euros worth of books inside, sat peacefully outside in the elements.\n\nThe only positive note: according to my mother, the books are a little damaged, but not too much. At the weekend I stop by to pick them up and see the extent of the damage.",

I remember some assholes I went to America on a study holiday with who idolized Bilzerian and other billionaire playboys, saying that they surely deserved what they got, and that envying others is for losers.\n\nI'm sorry my dears, the losers are not the envious, but those who have to work hard to earn and enjoy life. Envy is a more than natural thing, which often signals us that someone is cheating us in some way.

Putin himself said today that a genocide is happening in Donbass, providing himself with the pretext for Hitler-style attacks.\n\nTonight he will give us the final verdict, if they don't invade now they won't do it again, also because the weather brings rain for a week",

I recently became single again and in the last few months more absurd and unexpected things have happened to me in terms of affairs than in several years before. At a certain age, life experience eradicates all those mental masturbations that you do when you are younger, and you automatically acquire an edge over those who still do them. And at that point even luck begins to look more on your side, if only because you open yourself up to many more possibilities.\n\nAnd I have a clear feeling that I'm only at the beginning, because at this time I've changed the record and I no longer have any intention of starting relationships with people like those in my past, lovable and good-hearted but either highly insecure or attached to styles of traditional lives and unable to understand the emphasis I place on enjoying life and interpersonal relationships, whether erotic or not.\n\nThe next girlfriend will either have a similar outlook on life to mine, or she won't.",

There are creams with \"filler\" ingredients but, since cosmetics cannot, by definition, penetrate beyond a central layer of skin, the duration of the effect is temporary.\nFurthermore, the cream should be chosen after trying several since their \"goodness\" also depends on our skin.

Never purchased online, so I can't say.\n\nIf you are not afraid of spending a little more and if you have good direct or indirect feedback, I always recommend going to a real jewelry store, one of those with an attached laboratory.

Get yourself a cappuccino maker with a round whisk on the bottom, they froth the milk which is a pleasure, it comes out nice and thick and above all consistent.\n\n2) forget about the super-automatic ones, they are famous for their unreliability, as you have noticed: making the grinding system automatic involves a lot of moving components subjected to considerable mechanical stress which invariably do not last long.\n\nI recommend a decent grinder and a separate espresso machine. Then you have to see how much you want to bother... since you're starting with the idea of ​​an automatic, I'll take it for granted that you don't want to bother too much, so I'd tell you to get one with a pressurized filter holder, which makes the results a lot more uniform.\n\nI leave the advice to others on the models because since I finished my \"home bar\" station I have lost the desire to keep myself informed about market offers and therefore I am not very up to date.\n\nIf, however, you don't want to bother with anything, but want to maintain decent quality, a pod machine like Didiesse Frog could be right for you: if you buy online the pods cost less than the capsules, they don't lock you into a proprietary system and the quantity of parts moving is minimal, so they usually last forever.\n\nObviously if you are really determined to get a super automatic and nothing else can satisfy you ignore this post, but know that you will have other hilarious adventures with repair services.",

The truth is that Christianity is considered a white, Western religion, which infuriates me.

For those who don't know, ADHD has a heritability level equal to height, as a genetic trait, or around 79%, so there are often more people who have it in a family.\n\nYou have also already had several problems at school, in your personal life and some serious psychiatric problems, so I think it would be appropriate to evaluate this possibility - which is at least plausible - so that you can live better and have a more precise clinical picture of yourself. Don't give me the usual criticisms of medicines blah blah they're not good for you etc - also because knowing her she would be very cautious, and even just cognitive behavioral therapy with someone who understands it would be a panacea for her, if they give her a correct and serious diagnosis and they focus on the right elements! We have also already talked about it and you find yourself in many of the symptoms.\n\nHowever, I live abroad and I was wondering if there was anyone here who can tell me the names of centers (edit: he lives in Northern Italy) that do the tests and which are serious or if there are some that you should stay away from, for example , so that you can carry out a particularly rigorous diagnosis or non-diagnosis process. I say particularly rigorous because you received a diagnosis of dyscalculia as a child and a personality disorder recently - you would therefore need someone with the courage to navigate a clinical picture that is perhaps not very easy or where perhaps incorrect or incomplete conclusions have been drawn in the past (even the co-incidence of personality disorders with ADHD is high, among other things, or one is diagnosed instead of the other due to oversights sometimes, so it all adds up a bit).\n\nLet me know and thank you very much in advance!!!\n\nPs. I know there are basically only nine truly for ADHD, but I thought I'd ask a more general question given the other characteristics and the possible relevance of other experiences.",

I'm writing here because I can't find conclusive answers - and I think the topic may be of interest to others.\n\nFrom what I understand, the living will is used to specify in advance the health treatments to be undertaken in the event of one's inability to communicate directly due to illness or incapacity.\n\nNow, euthanasia is illegal here. Is it possible to wish to declare that you choose euthanasia in case of disease X and carry out this wish in countries where it is legal?\n\nI ask this because my father was suffering from a very serious neurodegenerative disease that destroyed him in a short time. I will soon take a genetic test to see if I will also be affected by this disease, and if the answer is yes I would like to ensure that I do not have to suffer in the same way in the future.\n\nIs it possible to organize this way, or do I have to keep a pill full of emergency fentanyl to kill myself tomorrow?\n\nThanks everyone in advance for the replies.",

                "Testo del commento": "Passive euthanasia (letting oneself die by disconnecting the machines) is permitted in Italy: it was already admitted 15 years ago in the Englaro case, but the law on living wills (law 219/2017) has definitively confirmed it. Today you can fill out provisions with which you decide, in the event that you find yourself unable to do so in the future, which health treatments you want to receive and which ones you don't. These also include life support through machines, so you can allow the doctor to disconnect them if you keep you alive, and let you die. If a person finds himself unable to express himself and has not filled in the DAT, the Englaro criteria always apply: it is possible to hypothetically reconstruct what you would have liked to have done (this post on Reddit, for example, could be very strong evidence).\n\nActive euthanasia (asking the doctor to introduce a drug into one's body that causes death, because death does not occur on its own by disconnecting the machines, or occurs slowly and painfully) has been partially legalized by the ruling of the Constitutional Court on the Cappato case , but has not yet been regulated by law. Therefore, even in the cases admitted by the Court, someone must take it upon themselves to help you die (more precisely: kill you) and undergo criminal proceedings in which the judge should then acquit them because the fact no longer constitutes a crime. You cannot achieve this result with the DAT, because in them you can only decide which health treatments to support or refuse, you cannot make more generic expressions of will (\"take me to Switzerland\").\n\nIn short, it all depends on the situation you find yourself in: an irreversible state with no hope of cure, kept alive by machines? You are \"lucky\" and can immediately let yourself die. Irreversible state but self-sufficient and capable of living for a sufficient time even without any health treatment? The path is much more tortuous. It is no coincidence that this absurd disparity in treatment for two situations that are actually very similar is the main argument on which the aforementioned unconstitutionality ruling is based.",

Moreover, even if it were admitted, it could not entail any obligation to cooperate on the part of the health workers.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, the only case in which a doctor can kill is in the case of execution after a regular death sentence, outside of that case there's no question of it at all.",

In Italy no one gives a shit about \"improving and/or saving someone's life\", they don't care about their own backyard, their own business and their own pennies, about nothing else. Zero trust in others, zero [social capital](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitale_sociale_(sociologia).\n\nNot only does this environment not reward prosocial behaviors, such as volunteering, but it actively stigmatizes and punishes them. Have you ever heard of the concept of [Antisocial Punishment](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/319/5868/1362)? I advise anyone who hasn't heard of it to google it because it's enlightening: in certain contexts people are punished for being too generous, behavior which, it is feared, could put everyone else in a bad light. It goes without saying that the greatest predictor of this type of behavior is poor social capital. Exactly the Italian situation.\n\nI have been a blood donor for about ten years, since university. Became regular over the last 5-6 years. I do a lot of sessions because I only donate plasma, which can be donated more often than whole blood, and this has voluntarily or involuntarily come up in casual conversations over the years. Let me tell you this: outside the blood transfusion centers my activity as a donor received **only blame**, I heard from multiple pulpits that I was \"stupid\" because \"it hurts\" and \"you're ruining your health\" and my vein could have \"burst\", that \"it is of no use\" because \"they sell blood\" and that the day the blood was useful to me I would have been \"left to die\". Honorable mention for an idiot who complained about the fact that plasma is used particularly in the operating room and that the hospital operating rooms were all \"full of southerners\" and that therefore donating plasma encouraged the \"southerners to come here to be operated on \". All this in Rome, not in the far north.\nI saw the same social hatred directed towards an ambulance volunteer, who was accused in my presence of volunteering to \"get out of work\". I see the same hatred every day in all media, directed towards those who volunteer abroad or at sea.\n\n\nYour question OP would also make sense, but in a **very** different context than the one we live in.",

(from the advertising on abortion, to the League's support for the gaffe in Umbria on abortion, up to even the super questionable advertising on euthanasia, etc.). In my opinion there is very little to defend, also because the video contains false data, such as for example that LGBT+ people are already protected, that reported cases of homophobia are very few and that we will have to live in a new reign of terror so at the first gaffe you will be punished with prison, as if we were really in a dictatorial regime (all false things and denied by certain data).\n\nThe data speaks clearly and I realize that making an indiniaziona!!1!11 post is of little use, but I would like to understand how we came to be such a hostile country towards this community. Although the CEI does nothing to avoid fueling this problem, saying that religion is only to blame and that it is only the fault of the ignorance of bigoted/retrograde people, in my opinion, is quite simplistic.\n\nMaybe you can help me understand why there are so many problems regarding this issue and why there is all this hostility for a law that, let's face it, would be essential to have in a country of 2020 (just so as not to remain in the Middle Ages) . I place my hopes in this new law which perhaps, for once, will pass and will not provide a simple sop as it was for civil unions.",

In any case, I'll try to give my very personal opinion: in my opinion when you ask yourself why there are so many homophobes, transphobics, but also racists in Italy, you are looking at the problem from the wrong point of view. The real question is: how were people formed who managed to overcome the barriers of prejudice and accept what is different?\n\nFor simplicity's sake, let's consider only the problem of homophobia: I am of the opinion that homophobia is an attitude that forms spontaneously in all communities that do not directly address the problem. The statement \"we are born homophobic\" may seem strange, but let's try to argue a little further...\n\nMy girlfriend's grandmother went to do a hairdressing course in Veneto in the 70s: she didn't have the slightest idea of ​​the existence of homosexuals. As soon as their teacher introduced herself, she sensed that \"something was wrong.\" She was so \"feminine\", and she was actually very impressed, almost scared. Nowadays, she considers gays as some kind of fashion, and she always looks at them wrong, and yet no one taught her to be homophobic.\n\nAnd here we are at the essence of my speech: what determines the formation of homophobia, transphobia and more generally racism is the lack of information and the failure to address such delicate issues on a continuous basis. I too was homophobic until I was 13, but then I started listening a little here, a little there, and then I realized how completely wrong I was. However, some reflection was necessary on my part, as a child no one taught me to have an open mind from this point of view. Only by browsing the internet did I understand how important the topic is and I changed my mind.\n\nIn conclusion: a society can overcome prejudices of any kind if and only if the topics in question are addressed on a daily basis, thus training the citizen. Not continuously addressing these problems implies the natural formation of phenomena of hatred towards those who are different from us",

Anyone can say what they want with the means they have, but then it is right not to complain about having been punished by the law.\n\nThis is fundamental because the person, regardless of everything, will still be able to say what they want, but this does not mean that this attitude must be hidden under the excuse of \"freedom of speech!!1!\": gratuitously offending a certain category of people without any valid reason, which among other things does not exist, puts their coexistence and their reputation within a society like ours at risk. The subjects in question \"have the right\" to harm people both verbally and physically without actually paying the consequences of their actions (or at least they do, but for other reasons and not always; I also remember the recent and umpteenth [ episode of homophobia](https://www.ilmessaggero.it/roma/news/coppia_gay_perseguetata_ogni_giorno_insulti_spinte_e_minacce_con_pale_e_bastoni-5302915.html) in Rome, for which we do not even know if the subject will, in fact, be punished). Theirs is a dangerous and unjustified motive, which is not pursued: ergo, all people are not ensured that they are protected by the law, which should instead ensure their well-being and more.

My sisters get along, and every dinner/lunch there is my mother sitting in the kitchen like the matriarch she is, telling us what to do and how to do it, but if we do it equally well but not as she wants, there are endless arguments.

        "Testo del post": "Hi guys, a \"friend\" of mine, so to speak, brought my attention to the case of [Chiara](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiara_Corbella_Petrillo).\n\nA TL;DR is that this woman had the terrible misfortune of having two pregnancies with severe birth defects. In the first the anencephalic child (without a brain, he would certainly have died), in the second there were serious malformations and lack of limbs; Both died after 9 months of pregnancy and childbirth (I believe the reluctance to have an abortion is due to a religious background, so much so that she is now blessed).\n\nThen, finally, during a smooth pregnancy, the couple has a healthy baby, and the woman discovers she has carcinoma. She decides to carry the pregnancy to term and then go to therapy.\n\nI didn't feel like discussing the matter with this acquaintance of mine with whom I'm not comfortable discussing certain things, so I turn to you anonymously to understand what you think and to discuss the ethics of the matter.\n\nWithout unnecessarily leading to eugenics, in my opinion I find the idea of ​​treating all life as unique and untouchable, to then prolong the suffering of a fetus destined to die, not to mention the suffering brought to family and loved ones ( obviously the suffering of these is a minimal percentage, but still significant, in my opinion).\n\nI am not a mother (male and perhaps childfree), so I cannot understand the suffering of this thing, but I find that the whole story is a bit obscured on a media and face-value level. I think it is important to discuss these things, and the choice made during the third pregnancy is a personal and important choice, but this does not take away the stubbornness in wanting to bring lost pregnancies to term, in the hope that they are a *sign* or a plan*.\n\nUnfortunately, however, I have a bias in this question, so I ask you to open a little discussion on the matter.",

It is a selfish choice, in my personal opinion, to have yet another child, which will not allow the others to go to university (ok, there are allowances and scholarships and everything, but we should try to be at least independent, at least because you can't support yourself completely with scholarships)\n\n\nedit: having said this I am absolutely pro choice, everyone should do as they think is best for their situation",

Well, despite everything, she says that if she could have known earlier that he would be ill, he would have had an abortion.

However\n\n- This does not mean that cancer is a beautiful thing or that if you have cancer you have to be happy because she was happy, taking a difficulty as a \"gift\" or \"opportunity\" is a very personal thing, you cannot tell it to another “come on you have cancer but it's a gift”\n- Enrico himself says “it's not that Chiara was pissing holy water”; and in the midst of everything you can imagine how much pain and difficulty in dealing with such a story on a daily basis\n\nObviously the whole story if you don't see it from a faith perspective is almost grotesque; However, in a certain context, Chiara's story has become \"bigger\" than herself: I personally have received a lot from her story, as have others I know, and this is difficult to see from the outside\n\nFrom a Christian perspective, apart from the \"transitory\" suffering (that's not saying much!), Chiara's story is joyful; that is, for those who believe it, Maria Grazia Letizia and Davide Giovanni went to the Father, as did Chiara\nThat is, for a Christian in some way life serves to become saints, death is a passage, just look at [how they sang at the funeral](https://youtu.be/R2txA2y3oB0)\n\nI conclude even if I haven't been very exhaustive on my thoughts by linking Chiara's [book](https://www.amazon.it/dp/8827010157/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_8cmsFbC226A71), written by friends; obviously it has a faith reading of history, but it also tells of the suffering and difficulties",

A woman should ALWAYS have the possibility and the means to choose whether to carry on with a pregnancy or not, but a child must not come into the world if it is not loved or wanted, if the mother for religious reasons does not want to abort it or keep the child in newborn adoption.\nAs regards the birth of children with health problems such as genetic diseases or malformations, that is an extremely complex issue which I sometimes also wonder about, but generally I think that prenatal screening should be mandatory for genetic diseases and Down syndrome and that if they test positive and the mother does not want to abort her child's future care is not within the NHS, at least for those diseases that prevent sufficient cognitive capacity and autonomy in adult life.\nAbortion must be an awareness of one's own life, that of the unborn child and of society. From the moment they are conceived until their death, a person influences everyone around them, if you don't love or don't want a child you shouldn't bring them into the world, if you don't have the means to support them financially even without welfare systems they shouldn't come to the world, if his survival beyond the life of his parents is linked to people who have not had the opportunity to consciously choose his birth he should not come into the world, if he does not physiologically have the possibility of experiencing the world as a healthy person and of contribute to society does not have to come into the world. In the third millennium it is absolutely unacceptable that there is still a dialogue on the abortion of unwanted children, contraceptive methods are effective, widespread and accessible to all and religion is NOT an excuse for one's personal choices. Life is respected by trying to reduce to the minimum possible the suffering and inconveniences that people may experience in their lives, but if your choices lead to your suffering, to that of children who came into the world in prohibitive health or economic conditions, people and of the society that are influenced by this new life, then the right to life ceases to be such.",

An embryo (even pre-embryo or whatever you want to call it), according to the laws of nature, proceeds to live and evolve until it is killed (or dies of disease). Therefore the Chiara case is morally legitimate (letting the anencephalic patient live until she dies for biological reasons, although it is right to use medicine to reduce suffering), just as her choice to continue the pregnancy at the cost of risking her death is legitimate. skin (the unborn child is not guilty of still being alive, and therefore should not be executed). If faith is also involved in the whole matter, the matter becomes more complicated because some people are really allergic to anything that even has a vague Christian smell (they make much less fuss when there is some bizarre and exotic religiosity involved) . However, we are still alive here and we can have a discussion because in the months before our birth no one decided for an abortion.\n\nThe problem lies in the people (and in the poor coincidence between \"legal\" and \"moral\"): if they _decide_ that they want abortion (or if they just have an opinion clearly in favor of abortion), no reasoning and no scientific data will be able to convince them . For example: born prematurely at just over 20 weeks are they now successful adults with a life worth living, while others were aborted at 23-24 weeks? He doesn't care. People with multiple health problems who survived a medical abortion? They are happy to live (even the sisters [Abby and Brit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abby_and_Brittany_Hensel), thirty-year-old teachers, where it would have been much easier to be less squeamish about faith and abort the monster) . And it is not out of place to remember that most suicide attempts end without suicide, because until the last moment one can still change one's mind and want to live. We are biologically made to continue living (as long as health allows it), not to arbitrarily interrupt our (or others') lives, despite the \"culture of death\" (typical of every irremediably decadent society - like ours) being on a cultural level rather successful (despite tragicomic paradoxes: people with a fear of Covid who fly into a rage if they see someone without a mask, and then are irreducible Taliban supporters of abortionism). We are at the point where life is a commodity for those who can afford to [pay the price](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/we-can-and-must-put-a-price-on- human-life-p9m3z50jp).",
