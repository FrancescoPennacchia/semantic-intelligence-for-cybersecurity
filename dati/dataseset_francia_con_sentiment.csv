"Literally üòÇüòÇüòÇ Nothing to worry about.

I want to understand that Christian thinking on death strongly influences Western thinking on the subject. So obviously it's an interesting vision among other visions of things and it's interesting to talk about it.

However, I am an atheist (agnostic when I am in a good mood), so death has nothing sacred, suffering from an incurable illness leads to absolutely nothing, being dependent in all your daily tasks is not an life, degenerating neurologically to the vegetable stage is ridiculous because I haven't been here for a while, etc. IN MY OPINION. No one is obligated to share my thoughts. If believers can make sense of this, great.

Nothing legitimizes the incurable and unbearable suffering in my eyes. I don't want to wait for the excruciating suffering at the end before being injected with morphine and then letting myself die of hunger and thirst to finally return my skeletal body to my family.

Ideally, I want to have planned the day a little in advance of the fateful period, experience everything that I can still experience with my beautiful loved ones, then plan a festive day of goodbye, eat well, laugh, say my goodbyes, a big hug to everyone in an atmosphere that has become more solemn, I tell them to celebrate my life not my death, and then I go to a room with the doctors and with the relatives who want to be present, I say a last goodbye and I'm leaving.

It's sad but I don't see the point in letting myself waste away or leaving my family with one last image of me in suffering and deep sadness. No! I was happy to know you, happy to have shared this incensed and absurd moment of existence with you, thank you for everything, I love you, END SCENE. Instead of desperately denying the inevitable. I am going to die, at least let me have an opinion on the circumstances, let me leave with dignity and consciously surrounded by my loved ones.","['want', 'suffering', 'death', 'Nothing', 'thinking']",2022-10-30 11:31:55,"{'neg': 0.128, 'neu': 0.675, 'pos': 0.197, 'compound': 0.9657}",positive

"For once I took the time to read all the comments to the end. I counted two reasonable ones.

I am appalled that we have reached this level of verbal violence and gratuitous and agreed-upon frontal opposition, although probably no one has read the article due to the paywall.

Still going through the ad-ecclesiam attacks recycled for 60 years (pedophile megnemegne) by the same people who undoubtedly still tolerate uncle-toutouche at the Christmas table and who forget that in the meantime the Church of France has submitted itself to an examination external to which no other Institution has submitted before it (and none after for the moment). There is certainly still a little work to achieve the exemplary quality to which it should be but still...
  
But that we, as a society and in particular as a CSP+ micro-society like Reddit, are so incapable of confronting ideas to try to come up with a synthesis, and that we react to this level of epidermis and bleating sheep, it sincerely saddens me.
 
It is normal that we ask all experts in philosophical doctrines and social models their opinion on a question which goes well beyond the simple selfish act. We ask for the opinion of the president of the CEF, we ask for the opinion of philosophers, we ask for the opinion of caregiver associations, we ask for the opinion of patients, we even ask for the opinion of ordinary citizens drawn from the comes out even though Daniel Martin has absolutely never thought about the question. This is all normal and healthy.

You don't have to agree with this particular opinion (even if in this case you only read the headline and everyone knows that newspaper headlines are always chosen to reflect faithful to the content of the article and more in the opinion of the interviewee/s). But to refuse that someone, a fortiori someone who has the double legitimacy of having thought about the subject and of representing an institution which serves as a benchmark for a few million of our fellow citizens (not counting the fact that he probably accompanied more people at the end of their lives than anyone in the sub), expresses his opinion and that of the institution he represents, it is the beginning of a totalitarian thought which obviously does not shock many people here.

No because it is a bill put on the agenda as part of a parliamentary niche (i.e. a day reserved for a group). The time for debates is therefore limited and if the text cannot be examined in its entirety, it is theoretically necessary to resume during the next niche of this group.

https://www.lemonde.fr/blog/cuisines-assemblee/2020/10/09/la-gestion-du-temps-lors-des-niches/

In practice, the government can decide to take up the bill by tabling a bill (thus a government initiative) identical to the agenda for the weeks reserved for it.

"Hello everyone, I'm posting with a disposable account today so as not to link my main one too much with such personal subjects. A little discussion will follow so in order not to waste the time of those who are not interested, I will immediately point out that I am wondering about the opening of my micro-enterprise in the IT field following my future conventional break.

I also specify that if I post in the free forum, it is because:

* I don't dare create a thread on r/france just for my questions which probably don't interest many people
* r/vosfinances is quite active but I don't know if my question is really related to the sub (and frankly we are not in the context of r/conseillegal, too bad we should have an r/administrationFR)
* r/entrepreneurfrance is a little dead

But if no one can answer me here I will have a thread on these three subreddits. And if you have any ideas where I could get this information on reddit or elsewhere, I'm interested! I'm going to make an appointment with pole emploi but the portrait my friends gave me doesn't really make me want to trust them... I'm also going to do a presentation session with an accountant but given that micro-enterprises are generally out of touch with their problems, I'm not sure they can help me.

Here is a summary of my situation:

For several years, I have dreamed of stopping my professional activity. I have been an IT consultant for almost 10 years and over the course of this career, my skills have oriented me more and more towards functionality to the detriment of technology. As a result, I ended up doing mainly PMO strategy with a small part of technique on various PPM solutions. I master all these subjects well, my clients and my company are satisfied with my work, I have good benefits and a good situation... But hey, personally my passion is IT development, and I don't do any almost no longer today in the context of my professional activity. And frankly, project management isn't my thing and I've pretty much only been doing that for 3 years.

In short, this career does not make me happy and I would like to resign to take between one and two years of break to study and improve my skills in areas that are close to my heart and restart a career in development, if possible in the field of research and if possible with independent status. I put money aside to start this project, and a few weeks ago I announced to my manager and my HR that I was planning to resign.

Being on very good terms with my company and my customers, they were not really happy to hear the news but they understand my project and to give me a boost offered me a conventional termination under the following conditions:

* I'm staying three months longer than planned to pass the torch
* I accept an agreement binding us for 20 days of work at a preferential rate to amortize a little the cost of severance pay

I will not hide from you that between the compensation that my company must pay me and the allowances that the state must pay me, this solution suits me enormously. It's one thing to put money aside, another to have the prospect of doubling the amount: that would be a valuable help in setting up my business.

I inquired and learned that it was possible for me:

1. to wait for the end of my permanent contract
2. to declare myself as a job seeker at pole emploi
3. to create a micro-enterprise
4. to request [ACRE](https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/F11677)
5. to request [ARCE](https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/F15252) (use these acronyms........)

Which would allow me to honor my agreement with my company, set up my microphone and already be ready to invoice for future clients, and receive 45% of my unemployment benefits in two installments over six months to start my project.

Problem: I'm not completely inept when it comes to administrative matters, but this is too much. I don't know where to start, I'm afraid of doing something stupid, of having misunderstood something, of not being able to put together these files and therefore of crashing my project.

I would like to point out that my goal is absolutely not to optimize my taxes or anything else. I would like to be able to take advantage of my RC, at least part of my unemployment benefits and to be able to bill my clients as needed next year. No more no less. So here are my questions:

* Is my project (administratively speaking) feasible? Have I correctly understood these stories of conventional rupture, micro-enterprise, acre, arce or are there subtleties which escape me and would render my project obsolete?
* I trust my manager and my HR. On the other hand, I don't know the rest of the hierarchy well.","['Im', 'project', 'dont', 'would', 'one']",2021-07-08 11:30:17,"{'neg': 0.092, 'neu': 0.767, 'pos': 0.141, 'compound': 0.9937}",positive

In cases where it is applicable, the rule of compelling reasons does not concern the spouses of French citizens, their children, nor European citizens or assimilated, their spouse (married, civil partner and cohabiting partner), their children, having their main residence in Metropolitan France or who, in transit through France, reach their main residence in a country of the European Union or similar or the country of which they have nationality.


To attest to one of these compelling reasons, a sworn certificate can be downloaded from the website of the Ministry of the Interior. It must be presented, at the time of boarding, to the transport company and accompanied by the appropriate supporting documents. An indicative list of compelling reasons appears on these certificates.


Following the decree published on March 12, 2021, the following reasons were added to this list:

* married couples in a civil partnership but one of the members is established abroad for professional reasons;
* minor children attending school in France while the family home is established abroad;
* couples with children, one living in France, the other abroad and separated.

I had the impression of being at the table of Patrick's beautiful guests, of rubbing shoulders with Fr√©d√©ric Fran√ßois, Salvatore Adamo, Sophie Davant, Bernard Montiel... of toasting these *happy few* (and when I saw their empty cups on the table, I refilled myself), laughing at their witticisms...and I of course counted down the last seconds of the year with them before throwing a small handful of confetti (previously cut out of my ALDI leaflet) at the fateful hour, then to sway my hips in unison with Patrick and his naked dancers to the rhythm of the *Fiesta*, the *Sardines* and the *Masked Singer*.

"I'm staying with a friend to look after her rabbit for 1 month. She told me that at the moment she is struggling with a cockroach infestation at home. I'm surprised because it's often quite clean. I know that the corners that are difficult to access are cleaned less regularly, but generally speaking her apartment is clean. She told me that when her neighbor across the street moved she regularly saw cockroaches coming out of the apartment and into her house. The apartment opposite today was completely redone so normally no more cockroaches, they all migrated to my friend's house.

And last night when I got up at night I actually saw 4/5 rather large cockroaches. I plan to do a big cleaning even in remote corners. I also wanted to buy cockroach traps but I went to 3 stores and the aisle is always completely empty and it's always the ""cockroach trap"" part.

"Today I would like to talk to you about a problem in our French countryside (and in our cities, but to a lesser extent). This afternoon, we had our cat euthanized. A cat who lived 5 years. It probably doesn't seem like much to you, but for the illness she suffered from, it's a record: She had leukosis (on average 2 years of life expectancy in cats who have had it forever). Since her birth, she has been contaminated by an oncogenic virus, which weakens her immune system and triggers cancers (lymphomas, leukemia). Everything is linked to a single problem: in our countryside many do not sterilize their cats and do not vaccinate them either (even though a vaccine exists and is super effective, but when we collect a kitten which then turns out to be already sick , as in our case, well it's too late).

Below are the most beautiful excuses from unconscientious masters:

First the famous ‚ÄúI have no money‚Äù: lots of town halls and associations offer sterilization. Certainly not enough yet but if you don't have the money for this simple basic gesture and the vaccines well don't take animals, you have to be responsible.

Secondly, the equally famous ""it's nature and then the cat is not happy if she doesn't have babies"" and other nonsense like this: I would like these people to stop thinking of themselves as veto apprentices: cats strays threaten the balance of biodiversity in our countryside (they prey on small mammals and birds to such an extent that they are now not far from being considered ""harmful""). Moreover, a cat without babies is no worse off, two clicks on the internet and we see that it is a myth (without forgetting that many of these people stumble upon the litter in question... great trauma for the mother cat...).

In short, if you know people like that, send them the message: they destroy lives, they destroy families, they are monsters. Just for my cat's siblings, 5 families have lost their companion. Because of one stupid and not very smart guy. And unfortunately he's not alone...

"Hello, I don't know if I'm posting in the right place, but we learned three weeks ago that my mother's dog (labrador, 14 years old, epileptic and heart problems) also had a brain tumor. For three weeks, he has been under very expensive treatment, which apparently does not work since he continues to have seizures.
This morning is the third since the diagnosis. He shits and pees on himself during these attacks, his throat is bleeding because his treatment causes inflammation in his throat, he no longer gets up alone, has difficulty moving (he is no longer able to get on the sofa for example) and have difficulty feeding themselves.
When 3 weeks ago we thought the veterinarian would recommend euthanasia, he preferred to offer an expensive treatment, reassuring my mother by telling her that the dog is not suffering. Mmmh.
This morning, my mother had to call my brother-in-law who lives 30 minutes away by car to help her transport the dog in the trunk, since my mother is unable to carry him (40kg per doggo).
We made my mother understand that this time, we will probably have to have him injected.
Arriving at the vet, the latter saw my mother in tears, he said to himself, here is a good pigeon and without batting an eyelid, and in front of my brother-in-law, he said that the dog was not suffering, that he still did not recommend the euthanasia and that instead we will try a new, ever more expensive treatment and that we will review the situation in 72 hours.
For us it's just trying to make money, postponing the inevitable.
FYI, we're all going on vacation together tomorrow (well, my mother doesn't want to go with us anymore, that's understandable but hey) so if the same thing happens again as today, no one will be there to help to carry the dog in the car and it stresses us out.

Do you know what we can do? Go see another vet, my mother doesn't want to (well yes, you think, her veto is going in her direction, since she doesn't want to say goodbye to her dog).

For the record, our childhood dog died in terrible circumstances from the same situation. (died by hitting her head on the ground, trying to get up when she could no longer do so). We always resented my mother a little, without telling her, because if our dog had been euthanized at the vet she would have left more peacefully.

Sorry for this long message but I'm a little angry here.

Edit: after returning to the veterinarian at the end of the day with a view to euthanizing him, this time another veterinarian, the latter gave him an expensive treatment (what is their problem??) and told him that the Euthanasia was not possible because according to him the dog was doing well. So same opinion as the 1st.
So good that this morning, my mother went back there because of new attacks. Well the dog didn't make it, he died in the car.
Frankly, what's the point of ruining the Google reviews of these two vetoes? I'm itching.

Furthermore, education is all well and good, but the richer you are, the easier it is to access. A kid who is born with an unemployed dad and a mom who is a cashier has fewer educational opportunities at any age!

"1) No, a carbon tax on both national production and imports (coupled with a carbon dividend but at the ecological level it is secondary) is the best solution. Nuclear power is a good solution in terms of electricity, but Co2 is not just an electrical problem.

2) No, in a secular state religion is not prohibited in the public sphere, it is not prohibited to publicly show one's belonging to a faith or cult. And so no, I cannot accept this proposal. And I say this as someone who considers himself anticlerical. But for me this does not justify state atheism. Freedom of conscience includes religious freedom even if I disagree with the religious idea. And I do not see what right would deprive a citizen of this freedom of expression in the standard framework of civic life (as opposed to the specific case such as a civil servant in his functions).

3) No for the increase, quite simply because given our level of taxation I have difficulty seeing how it actually increases. We have an average rate on each euro of income of 56%. Afterwards on the maintenances, yes, we are not going to massively cut the overall budget, even the tax/expenditure cuts are in fact minimal compared to the total budget.

4) the inequalities of what? If it's disposable income not really, the d2 after taxes is 30k per Uc, the d9 is 50k. In this gap, you have 80% of the population. So no, in terms of income, inequalities are not really a problem. If it's wealth inequalities, I would also say no because what I want is the reduction of wealth poverty and not wealth inequality, but unfortunately given that France has chosen just-in-time for its pensions , we increase wealth poverty (and wealth inequalities)

https://blog.insee.fr/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/fig2-decomposition-de-la-redistribution-du-revenu-national-en-2016.png

5) Perhaps, reducing income inequalities involves increasing primary income, through education, the establishment of infrastructure, and a legal system. And through taxes and transfers. It's a dual system.

6) no, discrimination on religious grounds must be prohibited. Afterwards, yes, it is possible not to like Islam but not to have a problem with a Muslim.

7) yes, there are problems. The goal of a state with immigration is to import people who are richer and more productive than the average. The best is when they are fiscally positive (more than 35k per Uc). Below that, from a tax perspective, it's a loss. (to be nuanced because you have some name given when you are an immigrant but it is to give an idea. Afterwards on the social aspect, it is not that he is Muslim the problem. If we imported American evangelists, or extreme Hindus, that would pose the same problem to me. It's just that we import people who are religious into a secular system, which adds its share of problems.

8) clearly, thesis salaries even in level stuff are shit. And salaries are generally low in France in tech, to have friends in engineering doctorates, except to work in ultra-specific labs, you don't stay in France. Why bother when you can get paid more in the USA or Canada for example. So in France we like to say ‚Äúyes but we have social security‚Äù.

5 in fact public education is the answer Yes and no, we must stop wanting to create statuses and castes

7 the problems linked to immigration are due to determinism.
Former slaves of imperialism who obtained their freedoms were offered the opportunity to come to France to work to restore the country to the level it was before after the Second World War.
Then were parked in ghettos so as not to mix with white French people
The public authorities have abandoned them over time because the public authorities have always been managed by the same political families since the end of the 30 glorious years.

11 the problem is not the car, it's the pollution that it causes and even if tomorrow we discovered clean energy that does not pollute if it is to go eat a sandwich in a park or at the beach and leave everyone your waste on the ground is useless

Possibly, afterward the government is also linked to companies who want the machine to run as usual to make money as well.

I wouldn't put it like that.

The State does not have to condemn personal preferences, but to rebalance behavior so that everyone's interests are respected.

In practice this may mean penalties corresponding to the external harm caused, or already starting by no longer subsidizing certain harmful activities, but it is not a question of anathema or of outright prohibiting any choice of lifestyle, both that we pay society what it costs.

> Gentlemen of the jury: The best friend a man has in this world may turn against him and become his enemy. His son or daughter that he has reared with loving care may prove ungrateful. Those who are nearest and dearest to us, those whom we trust with our happiness and our good name, may become traitors to their faith. The money that a man has, he may lose. It flies away from him, perhaps when he needs it the most. A man's reputation may be sacrificed in a moment of ill-considered action. The people who are prone to fall on their knees to do us honor when success is with us may be the first to throw the stone of malice when failure settles its cloud upon our heads. The one absolutely unselfish friend that a man can have in this selfish world, the one that never deserts him and the one that never proves ungrateful or treacherous is his dog.

> Gentlemen of the jury: A man's dog stands by him in prosperity and in poverty, in health and in sickness. He will sleep on the cold ground, where the wintry winds blow and the snow drives fiercely, if only he may be near his master's side. He will kiss the hand that has no food to offer, he will lick the wounds and sores that come in encounters with the roughness of the world. He guards the sleep of his pauper master as if he were a prince. When all other friends desert, he remains. When riches take wings and reputation falls to pieces, he is as constant in his love as the sun in his journey through the heavens.

> If fortune drives the master forthwith an outcast in the world, friendless and homeless, the faithful dog asks no higher privilege than that of accompanying him to guard against danger, to fight against his enemies, and when the last scene of all comes, and death takes the master in his embrace and his body is laid away in the cold ground, no matter if all other friends pursue their way, there by his graveside will the noble dog be found, his head between his paws, his eyes sad but open in alert watchfulness, faithful and true even to death.

"Hello, this is my very first post because I need help on a somewhat delicate subject... (unfortunately)

My girlfriend and I adopted 2 female rats, now a little over 2 years old each, Choupette and Poupette.

They are at the end of their lives, they are potentially suffering because they are sick (blood in the urine), porphyne flowing from their eyes, blood coming out of their nostrils swelling; The symptoms are not at their peak I think but it is alarming. So we went to the vet... 68‚Ç¨ to tell us it's a cold while giving me medicine for... I've never peed blood for a cold personally.

So if it doesn't get better with medication, if it gets worse in the next few days, I will euthanize her if she suffers too much. Except that the vet is dead (cause: The vet does not want to euthanize them). So here is :

Our political system is undemocratic, allows the renewal in power of the same social class (the rich, and when I say the rich, I'm talking about the real ones, the 1% and all that).

 To finish my comment, imagine that young people all went to vote, for a candidate regardless of his politics, this candidate to the general surprise(s) does not respect his program (if it still happens). What do young people do, they are not happy, they were scammed, but voting me is the solution (see the postulate above), they will vote for another guy who has an interesting program, this guy is elected, and we is all proud of the impact of young people in political life, the abstention rate is much lower than over the last 20 years. And the president, to everyone's surprise (copypaste all that), does not respect his program. And we good citizens that we are are of no use, because we have no direct or indirect political power.

Voting is absolutely not a solution, we need a fundamental debate (this is already the hardest step) to know what political system the French want (knowing that they are sovereign in a democracy) , and see how we can develop the system. There is no person with a chance of being elected who will create a democracy in France.

Well, I'm inflamed, but the vote is so useless, even the pseudo political ideas ""right"" or ""left"" don't mean anything, Hollande was more to the right than Sarkozy. We tested this system, where the rich choose candidates for whom we vote, it allows us to maintain the illusion of democracy. Just listening to the number of times we use the word democracy to designate our political system, it's aberrant. And the fact, that we have people on TV who make fun of dictatorships because it's anti-right, anti-everything (which is potentially true in itself) but we live in a dictatorship too, it's just that it's not embodied by a person but by a social class that is a minority in number and a majority in money. So yes, great we have freedom of expression (it's a good thing, I think), but if we have no political power, what is the use of this freedom of expression apart from occupying ourselves with the phantasmagorical delusions of political figures.

"> If you don't vote, you don't count

It's true, but at the same time, when the abstention rate is high, it means that something is broken in democracy. This should be a strong signal for those in power to implement changes so that people believe in politics again. At least we have the chance, unlike some countries, to have the right and not the obligation to vote.
For me, making voting compulsory is proof that the democratic system in place has failed.

Personally, unlike /u/BowieUndone above, if I'm not going to vote, it's not out of laziness, but because I stopped believing in politics a long time ago. Whether you vote right or left, it's exactly the same thing. It's all a big charade designed to give people the illusion that they have a choice and can choose to change things.

Basically, if you analyze the last important choices (Brexit, American primaries and American elections), the choice of young people was not followed at all.

"> I think that the notion of priority of problems and choice of actions is very important (short term <-> long term) and that the political choices of seniors in recent years are exclusively short-term choices.

I don't really agree with that. First of all, I don't think that Brexit or Trump are short-term choices (it's more a return to sovereignism, even if manipulated); but above all, short-term choices imply immediate interest, therefore in particular personal interest, while in contrast a long-term choice would be more for the general interest at the expense of particular interest.

It seems to me that if those over 50 vote for Fillon and his retirement at 65, for example, it is precisely for a long-term overall vision, rather than for short-term personal interest (me first). It would piss me off to work longer, but it seems necessary to me). As I said in another comment, seniors also have the best interests of their children and grandchildren at heart.

> I also explain my opinion on the difference in orientation of the young vote and the senior vote, in particular because of our culture which is very different.

For me, what explains the difference in voting between young people and old people is that young people are in rebellion, revolution, we want to break everything and rebuild the world, we are all brothers and sisters, love and flowers ; and then when we get older, we calm down, we fall into line, we realize that we cannot change the system and that improving it a little would already be good. It's a natural process, we become conservative because ""it was better before""; we want to be able to preserve and pass on the little we have acquired; when we are old we don't like change, we are more afraid; but also when we are old we have learned more, we know better that revolutions rarely go well, and we become more cautious.","['interest', 'choices', 'shortterm', 'dont', 'particular']",2016-11-29 13:59:42,"{'neg': 0.043, 'neu': 0.787, 'pos': 0.17, 'compound': 0.9942}",positive

On the one hand there are the ""terf"" feminists who say, social gender exists and it is an aberration of society that must be eliminated because it comes from relations of domination, particularly that of men on the women. Trans people are therefore enemies because they find themselves in the social gender.

On the other hand, the transidentitists (?) who say, there is no need to question social gender, and this must be separated from biological identity. Terf feminists are enemies because they want to abolish social gender.

The ideological divergence is therefore around social gender. Not about its existence, but about its merits and how to consider it for the future of society.

"So, to be schematic. Because otherwise, it goes in all directions. And my goal is not to write an academic article on this post.

Already, basically, terfs is an overused term, which was initially used to characterize radical anti-trans feminists. For them, gender, as well as heterosexuality, is a social construct that must be destroyed, because it is what leads to male domination. Additionally, for some terfs, gender is also a social construct. And one of their ways was to live in a female community. As a result, trans women, by changing gender, are seen as colonizers who seek to destroy the female class in order to ensure the survival of patriarchy. And trans men as well as heterosexual trans people are class traitors, because they prevent the destruction of patriarchy and heterosexuality.

Now, the term terfs refers to all women who claim to be feminists, even if they have no ounce of radicalism, like moutout or stern. Stern, moutot, or rowling, it's rather gender and sex are social realities and trans people cannot change sex/gender.

But overall, for terfs, gender change remains a danger for the female class.

On the side of trans people, there are several approaches. There is the innate side, where the gender identity which is innate is different from the sex at birth. There is the queer transfeminism side, close to queer feminism, which considers that sex and gender are social constructions, but that to put an end to patriarchy, it is better to favor the multiplicity of genders/sexes. And there is the transmaterialist side (for France at least) of considering trans people as class defectors, and which analyzes everything against the backdrop of class struggle (men vs. women, trans vs. cis) and on the materiality of body. But actually, the central point is that gender is not always correlated with sex.

Basically, roughly, you have more or less identified the terf and trans ideologies. On the other hand, the divergence is not linked to gender. The divergence lies in whether or not it is possible to change gender/sexual class. Yes for trans people, no for terfs.

So. Ps, I'm trans, which should therefore give an indication of which side of the debate I'm on.","['trans', 'gender', 'class', 'terfs', 'people']",2022-09-08 19:53:31,"{'neg': 0.067, 'neu': 0.875, 'pos': 0.058, 'compound': -0.5346}",negative

No, but they generally don't come up with their arguments from the depths of their ass and have knowledge on the subject (ie not ""I spent 5 minutes on the subject and I asked a question about ELI5"").

>Are these the new priests of modern times who are imposing their morals on us?

No.

A set of parameters including: ‚Äúpossible abuse of a situation‚Äù, ‚Äúfacts preceding the situation‚Äù, etc.

>I'm fed up with these so-called experts who impose their morals on us

OK.

>I find that we give exaggerated importance to this ‚Äúethics committee‚Äù!

In my opinion, we have often not listened to them enough.

>Who are they to decide that I must become a bedridden person and not be euthanized if I wish?

People. But nothing stops you from taking a rope and going into the forest, eh.

>Who are they to decide whether or not my wife can *lend* her womb to her sister who has uterine cancer?

Because it's very cute but there are also unscrupulous people who are ready to exploit girls in fragile situations so that they lend their uterus while they pocket the money. This is not a generality but it is taken into account.


>What ethics can decide for us what we have the right to do or not do with our bodies?

If you decide to drink a liter of vinegar in public because vinegar cures chemtrails, the people nearby are not going to stand by without reacting and will try to stop you from doing shit. It's human and that's how it is.

- then you go up to 14‚Ç¨/month the following year by a short email ""we have the pleasure of increasing the price of your subscription for your greatest pleasure"" oh thank you no need to, it's so nice, ok ok good luck that I am I pay.
- Then 1 year later the same email but this time to announce 18‚Ç¨/month there in general you start to find out about the termination procedure.

I therefore send the registered letter A/R (unable to pay less than ‚Ç¨5...) be careful there is a standard letter to fill out available on the site, given their practices I added it in the envelope in addition from a more conventional termination letter, you never know...

I sent a short email in addition to the registered letter to warn that I was canceling and quickly give the reasons in the hope that they change their commercial policy.

After receiving my email they made me a commercial proposal (9.90‚Ç¨/month for 1 year then 14‚Ç¨ and 18‚Ç¨ afterwards... great) and fortunately I read the entire email including the small lines because if you don't respond it's because you accept ""please respond to this email if you decline our offer"".
They will send me this email again upon receipt of the A/R which I will of course decline again.

In the end, apparently sending a return letter is not obligatory, an email is enough but I was not able to check.

"Hello sub,

Here I think that like many Francis, there are many people here who are against euthanasia, having a very radical position without really knowing the subject and who adopt this posture more in agreement with your moral values ‚Äã‚Äãand fantasies around the subject . As I was one of these people and given current events, I wanted to share with you my experience which led me to change my mind on the subject.

So for the story, I have two of my grandparents who died of incurable and very painful illnesses (respectively a G-P of 71 years, skin cancer which turned into generalized cancer and a G-M of 98 years , leukemia + kidney failure) so unfortunately I have very specific experience of what the end of life is, how it happens in hospitals from a patient/family point of view.

Edit: maybe not precise, and note that I am not in the medical profession but let's say that I have had the same experience twice, twice too many I want to say.

Received idea: Euthanasia does not exist in France.

So I'll explain to you right away, in practice it's false. Today we support people in services called ‚Äúpalliative care‚Äù and we ‚Äúhelp‚Äù them to die.

How do we do it?

We sedate them and stop feeding them, people die of starvation or dehydration. In theory, normally, there is still an intravenous infusion of saline solution so that the body is not dehydrated and if the sedation is done well it may seem ok.

But in practice, the reality of hospitals (I will not go into the debate of faults on the part of caregivers or lack of resources/lack of staff) means that patients wake up (relatively often) due to lack of sedation and literally collapse and die. thirsty. I saw 2 of my grandparents die like this, including my 71-year-old grandfather. The saline drip just stuck to his skin, weakly begging me to give him food and drink when I visited him. And my grandmother had an intramuscular injection instead of an intravenous injection whose arm was swollen by the solution flowing into her muscle tissue (if you have ever seen a drowned person it was the same on his arm).

So for now it's relatively effective, in one week people die, it works very well however I won't tell you the ordeal for sick people, who in addition to suffering from their already painful illness, die of thirst and hunger For days. Nor the trauma for families when you see your loved ones transformed into zombies asking for water like beggars. And the ordeal of knowing they are suffering without really knowing when it will end.

There is therefore no dignity for the person themselves or their loved ones who forever keep the disturbing image of a dehumanizing and degrading end of life.

I can already see some zealots telling me that all they had to do was jump off a bridge. To which I would answer them 2 things:

\- Firstly, if we had known what awaited our loved ones and the reality on the ground, we would probably have thrown them away ourselves, even if it meant going to pick up and scrape the pieces on the asphalt. It would have remained less traumatic for everyone.

\- Deuxio, your fantasy of incurable illness romanticized √† la Breaking Bad, where people in their fifties in apparent good health learn from a doctor that they only have 3 months to live then go out to continue to live their last moments with their family or go around the world to make their dreams come true before dying is only a fraction of the reality. You should go take a look at the geriatrics, I think you would have some surprises.

For my grandfather, for example, from the moment the diagnosis was established he was no longer able to move on his own. As for my grandmother, she had been very handicapped for years, she could no longer move or communicate except by gestures of the head and one hand. Medical helpers came daily to wash him (including wiping his buttocks). For your information, my grandmother wanted to see the sea again before she died, she could not fulfill this wish, because we did not have the means to pay for medical transport. So I'll let you give me an action plan to tell me how to commit suicide in the circumstances in case it happens to me, I'm impatiently awaiting your (brilliant) ideas...

I will also spare you the detailed narration from patients in neighboring rooms that we hear in the corridors during visits. Moaning and begging for help, making you think you're traveling back to the dark ages of the Middle Ages.

In short, I would simply say that I hope you never experience that. And I would like to add that I may have had a very dark version which does not reflect","['Feedback', 'euthanasia']",2021-04-09 12:12:24,"{'neg': 0.162, 'neu': 0.734, 'pos': 0.104, 'compound': -0.9964}",negative
"I am a nurse in a clinic that sees palliative care patients. Often people at the end of their lives, despite their wishes, can no longer eat or drink. They go wrong, liquids and food pass into the lungs and they choke. From this moment on and if the person refuses the therapeutic relentlessness we can no longer feed them.

Infusions (subcutaneous, intramuscular do not exist, NaCl is serum physiology we prefer glucose if there is a question of maintaining life) are for comfort, in order to avoid dehydration. The people we receive are so exhausted that they often leave quickly once their mind and body have calmed down (= a little shot of valium.....). They stop fighting. Legally it is not euthanasia, but it comes close. There is also deep and continuous sedation (hypnovel + morphine) for people who clearly express their wish. This is the only possibility of appeasement before death really authorized by law, but in practice it is rarely done. Free and informed consent at the end of life is rather rare...

I'm lucky to work in a service that is solely dedicated to that (a nurse and a caregiver for no more than 3 patients. A classic service is 1 ide for ~ 15 patients, and nursing homes are even worse), but it's so rare in France!! It's the only one in the city where I work, there is another one 40 minutes away. Afterwards I don't know anyone else around. This is one of the end-of-life problems in France. I am sincerely sorry that your grandparents passed away in pain. Even leaving euthanasia aside, people turn a blind eye to the end of life. We ignore it, we leave it aside. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just old people, eh, that‚Äôs normal.‚Äù Many forget that they are also fathers, mothers, sons/daughters, friends.

That's what I think I'm saying, afterward I'm not in the medical profession so I can say stupid things but from what I understand it's intravenous infusions of phy serum (into a vein)? What I'm saying is that in practice I saw my grandfather's IV simply placed (not pricked and taped to the needle to hold) and for my grandmother obviously the vein had been missed ( I think) which meant that the perfusion was intramuscular (or subcutaneous which is perhaps a more appropriate term) instead of being intravenous. The arm had time to swell, but no one looked and she stayed like that for 2 days before we noticed it when we visited her.

Afterwards I can understand that the working conditions are not ideal everywhere, from memory this was not the case in the hospital departments where my grandparents stayed, I no longer have the figures in mind but the number of nurses and caregivers seemed insignificant to me for the number of patients.

For now, I am not angry with the caregivers but with the system, although like everywhere there are people who are very careful and others who are very negligent in their work.

And unfortunately I would have liked us to be better informed about end-of-life possibilities, even among doctors it's a taboo subject I have the impression.

Concretely, you have to register with an association. There is a visit from a doctor (member of the association) to confirm that it is indeed the wishes of the patient, who will then have the possibility of triggering the process at any time.

On the decided day, a doctor (from the association) comes and reconfirms with the person concerned that this is indeed their wish.

A drinking solution is prepared (Orange flavor, it seems, I obviously haven't tasted it, but can be personalized...). The solution is drunk by the person, who falls asleep and then passes away peacefully in their sleep after a few minutes.

It's ultimately strange to associate opposition to euthanasia with religious sentiment. When you think you are coming and returning to nothingness, you can on the contrary think that a few years of suffering do not weigh much, that even a small potential to experience happiness once again, however fleeting it may be, outweighs everything. .

So yes, it's the religious people who tend to want to govern the lives of others and limit their choices, but the idea that existence is infinitely precious because it only lasts a moment is rather something profoundly atheist.

I'm talking about true atheism, the one that doesn't tell itself any stories, that doesn't even reassure itself with bullshit like ""it's the great cycle of life."" For whom the prospect of eternal damnation remains consolatory, because ultimately hell would be good news: it is always better than nothing.","['good', 'euthanasia', 'ultimately', 'religious', 'think']",2021-04-09 13:01:45,"{'neg': 0.117, 'neu': 0.698, 'pos': 0.185, 'compound': 0.901}",positive
"Yes there are arguments, are they sufficient? This is up for discussion:

\- Already, you assume that the only alternative to spending your last moments on earth in excruciating suffering, deprived of dignity and freedom, is euthanasia. It is discussed. We could imagine the development of palliative care, for example, offering an alternative.

\- Then there is the technical aspect, the doctors did not sign up for that, it is not their training, it is not their mentality, it is not their priesthood. Forcing them to practice this type of act, even when legally well-armed, would raise questions of conscience. But not entrusting this sort of thing to doctors also has its own problems.

\- Finally, there is the risk of drift. It is very important and supervision is difficult. Once euthanasia is legalized, the posts will no longer be about the unfortunate people who die in horrible suffering, but there will be just as many on ""They got rid of grandma by 'convincing' to be euthanized"" or ""Social security, for reasons of economy, announces that it encourages euthanasia rather than the treatment of such serious pathology"".

"I am sorry that you had such a terrible experience at the end of your grandparents' lives. I was lucky to experience excellent palliative care services where patients (and their families) were supported with gentleness and kindness and it is with sadness that I see that this was not your case.
We are clearly not ready for euthanasia in France, for the medical profession (the responsibility is great and so is the social pressure).
When the covid crisis began, it coincided with the authorization for doctors to carry out terminal sedation (deep and continuous until death) in the homes of patients at the end of life. Well, there was an outcry in the media, saying that we were taking the opportunity to kill our old people quickly at home so that they don't clutter up the hospital! While the Leonetti law has authorized terminal sedation for much longer for end-of-life patients who request it.
Most people faced with the end of life of their loved ones realize that they had a different idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe end of life, perhaps a little fantasized/imagined like that which we see in the films (people, silent and dignified in their beds, loving family next door, beautiful music on the soundtrack, etc.). In truth, death, just like life, is not very smooth, it is not very calm, and it is not necessarily very dignified. It sends us back to what is animal in us. We've just lost the habit, because instead of letting our elders and loved ones end their days at home, we send them to nursing homes or hospitals. I think that euthanasia should be an option for people who wish it, within a well-defined legal framework (fortunately we will not have to be pioneers in this matter, there are countries which are well ahead of us in terms of legislation and organization of medically assisted suicide). In the same way that I think that our palliative services should be expanded, and that we should talk earlier about patients' wishes regarding their end of life (and not wait until the moment when patients are no longer in condition). to express themselves, leaving decisions to the medical teams who must deal with family members who are often confused and in pain).","['end', 'patients', 'life', 'people', 'us']",2021-04-09 15:07:36,"{'neg': 0.08, 'neu': 0.771, 'pos': 0.15, 'compound': 0.9806}",positive

I'm sorry you had a traumatic experience during your grandparents' end of life. And unfortunately, as in many healthcare services, if you are not in a specialized unit with a correct patient/caregiver ratio, you are terribly short of time to support people in the last days of their existence.

Undercut hydration helps limit ‚Äúdeath of thirst‚Äù as you characterize it. Most people at the end of life are often in a daze of almost comatose sleep, reinforced by the use of midazolam + morphine therapy.
Sometimes the dosages are insufficient because they have to be re-adjusted regularly and it's horrible to learn that your GP has suffered from this.

Now for the slightly less... Legal side. The Leonetti law says, I paraphrase, that it is authorized to administer therapies with the aim of providing comfort and plunging the patient into deep sedation *even if this has the side effect of shortening life*. In two of the three departments in which I worked there is a sort of tacit and unspoken agreement. Doctors prescribe very high doses ‚Äúif necessary‚Äù and allow IDEs to have a ‚Äúheavy hand‚Äù on the doses.

It is therefore not rare, if not common, for certain IDEs, an open secret, in agreement with doctors, to do what is called ""pushing patients"". Basically, large doses of Moprhine, administered with documentation confirming their usefulness, accelerate the process of death in patients.

My colleagues and I often do this when the patient seems to be in constant discomfort, the family has already started the grieving process ""we just want him/her to go now"".

Of course, we don't talk about it openly, because it is forbidden to euthanize in France... But hey... I have already pushed patients, and I will push them back.

"Your story is quite poignant and I have no doubt that it is representative. Lots of interesting and touching comments, too (thanks for the movie recommendation [u/Stelteck](https://www.reddit.com/u/Stelteck/) ).

I have no real bias on the subject of euthanasia. But some food for thought:

\- I'm bothered by all the discussion around dignity; perhaps precisely because what dignity is should be the conclusion of a long discussion, and not one of its premises. If we consider that it is unworthy to be hurt (for example), a reasoning opposite to yours could lead to wanting to euthanize the incontinent.
\- The possibility opens the door to the will: the existence of euthanasia can encourage the desire to be euthanized. (I'm going to take the first analogy that comes to mind; as clumsy as it may be: the waves of suicides do not come only from a common cause, but from the act of a person who favors the one of his knowledge).
\- But must the will in the moment necessarily be listened to? For example, a 35-year-old depressed person who asks to be euthanized, should we respond to their request, or should we try to give them a taste for life again? (In practice we tend to wash our hands of it, of course)

We can of course take into account the person's age, health, etc. and here we come closer to the example you give.

Still, if the current situation still makes it possible to end life unofficially, or even illegally, that's already it. Well, it's true that it's not super exciting to go to prison because you helped a loved one die.

It seems to me that dignity is a concept essentially linked to the legal fictions that found societies. And our society recognizes both self-determination as a fundamental concept and the possibility of not being in full possession of one's means (without really knowing what that means): this creates a fairly vague field within which we can justify almost all arguments (if we divide them into 4 categories: pro-euthanasia with and without consent / anti-euthanasia with and without consent).

Personally, almost all legal frameworks suit me (among other things because we are always free to violate them); what concerns me more are social preconceptions (and legal frameworks help to define them; and we are less likely to violate them because they act directly on our ways of thinking).
To what extent is the suffering we have at seeing loved ones leave inherent to our ‚Äúhuman nature‚Äù, and to what extent is it ‚Äúconstructed‚Äù?
And to what extent should we flee this suffering rather than accept it?
To what extent is the dying person affected by the two previous questions?

"In fact, what I want to say through this testimony is that today we already have a framework.

Doctors can choose to send patients to palliative care, I know that makes some doctors upset, but it is a cowardly form of euthanasia. When we know that in certain cases in these services, there is a medical decision to no longer feed and to put people who can no longer eat on an infusion of phy serum only (saline solution). We already know that these people will die in the coming weeks or months, either from lack of food or from worsening of the disease.

So in fact all the abuses/borderline cases that you describe are already taken into account and I don't think there is any question of changing the rules in these cases. People do not enter palliative care because they have misunderstood or because they want to die. In any case, a 35 year old in good health who wants to die dies without any problem, he doesn't need anyone.

"My two cents on the subject:
  
I don't really know how to position myself clearly regarding euthanasia. A priori, I am someone attached to the free disposal of my body, I do not feel concerned by the religious taboo which reigns around death. So, rather for, at first glance.
  
But here it is: it turns out that I am suicidal, I have been depressed for 2 years now. It is not the first time. My life is, at the moment, a great suffering: I no longer have a taste for anything, I have difficulty maintaining a social circle around me, I am physically in pain at all hours of the day. I am not independent, I am sick. I don't know if this disease can be cured: maybe yes, but maybe not. However, if I wish to die with dignity, and not by throwing myself into the Loire, or from the 4th floor of my residence, I am almost sure that it will not be granted to me in the context of euthanasia. . And that's the problem: where do I draw the line between who is acceptable to kill and who should be kept alive? We cannot rely on criteria of individual consent (see my own example). So should there be objective criteria? Would this then mean that only certain illnesses or conditions will be eligible for the choice of death? This opens up immense moral dilemmas: why this one rather than another? What message do we send to people with an eligible disorder: the one that society thinks you're better off dead than alive? Conversely, what message for those who are not eligible: your suffering is not so terrible? What about the risk of subsequent abuse (I'm thinking of the woman who murdered her 3-year-old son because he was disabled, and who later wrote a book about it)?
  
The debate is really very complicated for me to decide, because the limits we place on our own life are constantly changing: we can decide that it's over for us the moment we can no longer walk alone, then when that day arrives, we postpone until the moment we can no longer speak. Ultimately, the cases where it is ""obvious"" are not that numerous, and the errors of assessment by doctors/relatives would be irreparable.

"I had a similar experience with one of my grandparents as well. It ended with 10 days of ascites and suffering in an onco department (because small town, small hospital, therefore no palliative service and that of the large university hospital 2 hours away was full as an egg). Even the morphine didn't do anything anymore.

Similar story for one of my partner's parents, in home care this time... seeing someone who was originally hyperactive and never complained, suffering and losing his mind on his bed for 3 months, I I don't know who it serves.

When my mother died a few years ago of a heart attack (facilitated by the accumulation of chemo over several years) the brutality of her death was suffering for us all of course... but mixed with relief: be sure not to see her diminished and suffering martyrdom in a hospital bed (which she also said she feared).

&#x200B;

And despite all that, I remain extremely cautious regarding the end of life, because given the evolution of our health system, I see a big risk of a slippery slope: that we start to finish off the old, that We are putting pressure towards this solution, not because it is the most ethically fair but because it costs less than maintaining or caring for them. There is more and more purely accounting management in the hostos, the lean management fads are more and more in power there... and very caricatured, an Excel table has no ethics.

"Euthanasia is actively killing people, and has nothing to do with palliative care.

Several considerations: the use of palliative care (and training for caregivers) is becoming more and more widespread, but it will still take quite a while before many are trained in these techniques.

Dehydration at the end of life increases the pain threshold; for dry mouth, palliative care services often use mouthwashes. Well-conducted palliative care allows patients' pain and anxiety to be properly treated without the need to euthanize people (except in extreme cases).

Euthanasia in concrete terms is: we bring a syringe of a deadly product that we inject and we watch the patient go into cardiac arrest. Most, the vast majority of caregivers, would exercise their conscience clause if such a law were passed, and even if services exercised it, nothing would guarantee that the quality of care would be improved.

Yes ! Generally speaking, as in most hospitals in France today, the quality of care is declining. Yes ! there are not enough staff, yes not enough resources, yes not the appropriate tools for good patient care. But I believe that we have finished applauding caregivers and that we have returned to the pre-crisis doctrine: I want exemplary medical care without spending a penny. It doesn't work and I repeat, the quality of care is steadily declining.

Afterwards, as mentioned elsewhere, to have quality care, nothing beats Switzerland where paying a lot of money guarantees you access to quality medical care. Personally, to get treatment I will do the same.","['care', 'quality', 'palliative', 'nothing', 'caregivers']",2021-04-10 05:42:43,"{'neg': 0.08, 'neu': 0.706, 'pos': 0.214, 'compound': 0.9924}",positive
">Euthanasia is actively killing people, and has nothing to do with palliative care.

So in fact we are going to go into details but no, your definition is wrong because it is partial:

There are two types of euthanasia, active euthanasia and passive euthanasia:

What happens in palliative care is indeed euthanasia, but a very specific form is passive euthanasia.

And again we could argue on the subject. For me it's active euthanasia in disguise. As I say, patients who can no longer eat or eat if there is a decision to eliminate the supply of glucose or water, this amounts to condemning them. To draw a parallel, deliberately cutting off the oxygen of a person on life support amounts to killing them, even if that person is condemned to die. why would this be an active act for oxygen, and passive for water or glucose? the 3 are essential elements for the proper functioning of the human body, right?

""The real question is can we prohibit everything and moralize everything? Given the success of this post I think that yes, freedom is not a current value. Let's see alcohol and cigarettes are expensive for society: a government or a party or a pressure group could well prohibit them? If we do not have certain skills and certain financial means can we have children could we not institute a permit? People spend their money poorly and do not invest it Couldn't we properly force them to buy certain products and invest their money in certain funds?
