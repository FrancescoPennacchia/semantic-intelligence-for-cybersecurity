"It is legal to help someone commit suicide if there are no personal motives involved (e.g. you cannot be paid for it etc.). Professional organisations therefore have lots of paperwork involved, also to prove that the patient requesting the means was actually competent to make that decision. So if you were to help somebody privately, and were to profit somehow or there are other people (e.g. family) that are not happy with that, I think you could get in trouble for it.

Active euthanasia by somebody is illegal, unless it is basically ""passive Sterbehilfe"" where you e.g. treat somebodys pain with Morphine, and to get good pain control you accept that this might be life-limiting.

There is assisted suicide for people with serious, untreatable diseases that will lead to death. I'm not sure if legally that includes psychiatric illnesses, but I doubt it (I'm no doctor but in my mind a psychiatric illness can't lead to death, at least not directly so is probably ruled out).

"So, working as a physician with some experience with patients who had EXIT:

Generally, there is no definite inclusion or exclusion list of diseases that you can use assisted suicide for. The disease will influence the process and success chances, though.

Basically, the patient who requests assisted suicide needs to be sound of mind, the decision needs to be well thought through and something that doesn't change over a certain amount of time. Up until some time ago it was generally limited to some life-limiting diseases that would have caused death in the course of disease anyway. There are now discussions to also allow it for healthy elderly people who just don't want to live any more, and the number of diseases that have been considered has grown increasingly. That is also where psychiatric illnesses come into play.

It is - depending on the illness - often difficult to say whether the conditions for an assisted suicide are fulfilled. E.g., if you have severe depression, thinking about assisted suicide may also be a symptom of the disease, but might also be something that a mentally healthy person might consider depending on the life-impacting symptoms of the disease. That's where the difficulties happen. Basically there needs to be good judging by the doctors involved in the case, whether the decision is made without being influenced by the psychiatric illness itself, and if it is a long-standing wish and well thought about. As many psychiatrists are new to this topic, it is usually quite difficult to actually get a statement on this - and if someone has a life-long history of mental health, probably a ""new"" psychiatrist will not be able to judge the wish within an useful time range.

While it's quit easy to judge someone's wish who is dying from cancer and in serious pain and the life would only be shortened by a few weeks, it's much more difficult to do so if the disease itself wouldn't naturally kill the patient within the next few weeks anyway - and the disease might itself influence the wish for assisted suicide.

So: it is possible to get assisted suicide for mental health conditions, but it is complicated and often difficult and I am not aware that it happens in significant numbers. It's most likely also the assisted suicide organisations who would like to err on the side of caution, because helping people who don't actually want to have assisted suicide committing it would be extremely bad publicity for assisted suicide in Switzerland and also world-wide, and would most likely decrease access to it even further.","['assisted', 'suicide', 'disease', 'also', 'would']",2021-04-12 19:06:32,"{'neg': 0.183, 'neu': 0.699, 'pos': 0.118, 'compound': -0.9903}",negative

Law about euthanasia in second link

Definitions
Passiv euthanasia: stopping things that are keeping the patient alive (hydration, food..)

Activ euthanasia: giving something that kills

Active Direct: in one go, meant to kill (not allowed)

Active Indirect: giving something to alliviate pain and suffering in increasing doses that will utlimatly kill the patient (tolerated I think)

So, euthanasia is more used in palliativ care situations, when the patient can't go through the channels of exit and the likes to get assisted suicide.

Which made me curious about other parts of Europe.   

My main question is, what do the Swiss think of euthanasia (assisted-suicide)? This is mainly due to a recent event of a Taiwanese, who is a semi-public figure, deciding to travel to Switzerland for assisted suicide. He was diagnosed with [terminal pancreatic cancer](https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3451430). And in Taiwan (as well as most of the world), assisted-suicide is still illegal.   

This made me wonder, what do people in Switzerland think of assisted suicide? A quick [Wikipedia search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthanasia_in_Switzerland) tells me that assisted-suicide is not as common as the news makes it seems, and its mostly foreigners who use assisted suicide. Does Switzerland have palliative care (hospice) centers for those with terminal illnesses? How are the services? And lastly, since I am in the healthcare/medical care industry, how is the healthcare in Switzerland?   
  
I'll be looking forward to read any response.   
Thanks. 

Edit: The term ""assisted-suicide"" might not sound familiar with Swiss, and I realized this may be due to how countries that are against this practice would use ""euthanasia"" with the negative word ""suicide"".

"Quick answer since I am on mobile:

Assisted suicide has a very solid support from the Swiss population. Attempts to abolish or further regulate the practise have been defeated at votes with a large majority.

On the other hand, the organisations that facilitate it are normally closely watched by prosecutors, and face opposition from religious minorities as well as a lot of issues with finding places to work from - everyone supports this stuff in theory but many people are not happy when such organisations operate nearby.

Switzerland does have palliative care - that is the more common route to go if you have a terminal disease. I can't speak to how good it is, but I don't think it's bad. 

Healthcare as a whole is  expensive - we have mandatory private health insurance with subventions for lower incomes - but way better then many of the neighbouring countries.","['organisations', 'many', 'Quick', 'answer', 'since']",2018-06-08 06:18:32,"{'neg': 0.072, 'neu': 0.766, 'pos': 0.162, 'compound': 0.9093}",positive
